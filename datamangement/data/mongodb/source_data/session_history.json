                            "text": "Doctor: Well how high are we talking? Initial reading will be 150/90, and then, you know, after relaxing you to come to about 138/85. Nice. That's, that's, you know, that's the highest I've ever seen. And probably some cholesterol tablets too. They're all heading kind of in the wrong direction. Uh, just increasing cholesterol and probably the big one is triglycerides? Uh, and you're heading towards diabetes as well. The HBA1C doesn't change, well, it lasts for 3 months, so it's not something which changes rapidly. Um, and it's been heading up since last year. So I think that's a trend. And then you had your colonoscopy. Is he doing anything about it? So he's going to see you again or what's my first? It's really unclear because like actually says high grade dysplasia. Which I don't like, that means that they are getting weirder. Like this, this isn't, you know, it's just a significant polyp to remove the colonoscopy. It doesn't say what else he wants, sir. What he wants to do about it. Because sometimes when you go to like the high grade range they want you in yearly. I'll email it as well because that's kind of, it's like pretty useless freaking letter. I mean, it's low grade, I'd be much less excited. So hi, so basically he goes low, medium, high cancer. Alright, so you're right, that's just like, oh, so some people like, no, we're gonna do this yearly until we're clear, some people are like, yeah, I just want to.Patient: Um, I am kind of wound up at the moment, so you want to do it, do you want to do it 24 hour? I don't think it's gonna prove anything that we don't already know. OK. I mean, you were considering, you said to be seriously considering blood pressure tablets. I think I do need them. Well, I was diagnosed as type 2 diabetes years ago. Um, and I was able to sort of keep that under control, but like I said, when I had those tests, I was, I was being really bad. I'm still not real good. In the report that I got, he said he found 5 polyps, I think it's a whole bunch they were uh they weren't a major concern. But um, and he didn't give me a, a another appointment to come back in 2 years, but, I presume that it's ongoing for my age. Yeah, when he spoke to me after the procedure, he seemed pretty relaxed. And the time before, uh, we found some larger polyps and he was, he seemed a little more concerned then, so. I, I contact these officers and find out. Yeah, I just took these kind of relaxed tone after the procedure that day wasn't too concerned. Um, and that, um, what he was writing in the letter was, credible standard for someone my age with my history. Hm, kind of what his history, you know, you know, my mum had um bowel cancer and that uh she was, theatre an operation for that um. So he's, he's, you know, well aware of family history.00:05:00 - 00:10:00Doctor: Heading well towards the diabetes, metabolically syndrome sort of thing. I think we should do something about that. So, I think blood pressure is a good thing to do to keep your kidneys safe. Something for the cholesterol to try and kind of just get a lid on that. And then I guess the options for, so technically you're not diabetic. But you're heading that way and I guess in my mind, diabetes like the set cut off at 6.5 for HP once a year at 5.9. Normal is 5.5. But it's probably not good being in that middle; it's not like everything's fine and then everything. Yeah, so you're halfway, halfway to making an official either way I'm more likely to fall the wrong way. Almost certainly will go the wrong way. Yeah, so that's kind of an arbitrary cut off. So I'm pretty aggressive about it because it's just a heck of a lot easier early than it is later. The thing is you're accumulating damage that whole time. You know, it's not like suddenly everything's fine, then everything's horrible. Things are getting progressively worse; you've got the sugar running around gumming up your plumbing. So there's a few options ranging from kind of cheap to expensive. Cheap is like metformin, which is your baseline standard sort of drug. You don't have any evidence of like kidney injury or anything like that yet, so that's good. So I'd say probably that's not a bad option. The kind of deluxe option is one of those new weight loss drugs. So like aic or um to zepotide. The big thing about them is that they help you lose weight; we know that carrying weight is one of the risk factors of diabetes. Yeah, that's good stuff that if you can lose 10 to 20% of body weight, all the risks drop back down. And that's kind of what these drugs offer. Mhm. They're expensive and they're an injection; it's probably the downside of it. Cost is roughly 450 to 650 a month. So you're looking at about 100 bucks a week. It kind of depends. Like if you do a takeout or two, that kind of works out that ongoing for life doesn't have to be, so it kind of depends on you, really. I mean I can't afford a lifetime of it. Yeah, so kind of depends on how good a change we manage to make. You know, if you use it for a few months and you manage to lose 10 kg and lifestyle-wise we manage to get everything else under control, you know, then you can probably come off it. You will likely regain some, but like, and that's kind of why I quite like the medication is it actually gives you a chance. If you can lose a chunk of body weight and then make some good changes, diet, exercise, all that, which is often easier when you're carrying a bit less weight. You know, I've got a couple of guys around there, 140 kg, so they can't do any exercise. He has a catch 22; they need it and they can't do it. Yeah, so that's kind of what I see it's useful. Some people like they just can't and so you end up being on it for life, though I'd expect most people. Like, so I've been using, I use to Zappatide more because it's got more weight loss potential; they quote it up to 20% like it's huge. And often even just a smaller doses, which I think are only 360 bucks that it's cheaper, because it goes from 5 milligrammes, 2.5 milligrammes up to 15, 15 is 645 is cheaper. I've already had stellar success just fiddling around the 2.5s for guys who've lost about 10 kilos in 2 months.Patient: Yep. Right. Oh, I can't afford that. A month, yeah. I mean I can't afford a lifetime of.Patient: So anticipate they'll probably stay on.00:10:00 - 00:15:00Doctor: So anticipate they'll probably stay on for maybe 6 months maybe 6 to 12. One of the interesting things about these medications, most people report craving less food. Actually reduces that kind of. Is it a habit? I'd prefer you to have nuts and jerky and that sort of stuff. So they did a good study in Google, so it's the same thing because there's a policy in Google you can't be more than 30 metres from a snack. So the snack sections put in everywhere. Everyone can have diabetes and everything because I had like all the bowls of M&Ms and pretzels and all this stuff. I still want to give people a choice, but it is cool behavioural thing where they just put it under the table. All the soft drinks were behind opaque glass, you know, water was visible, Healthy snacks were visible and that actually makes a significant difference because fundamentally we're fairly lazy creatures, you go for the available. So one of the strategies is to just make it harder to get. There are also time lock saves you can get. So, you know, you can only once a day or. Yeah, um, so yeah, look, there's strategies like that, so like, you know, putting them in under some sort of, just makes it harder.Patient: My big problem is discipline. I know I eat badly. I eat well, but I know I eat a lot of sweet stuff as well. And I don't exercise as much as I should. You know, I'll go for walks but not, not uh, I might go for 5 in one week and then I do one for a week. So I know that routine item with the routine and I with the regular diet. I don't know, maybe if I lost. Mine's not even a craving, mine is like I'm a picker. I'll go past food, pick it up and eat it. And I'll pick up the stuff that I can eat with one hand, you know, I'll grab biscuits or a bit of cake or something like that, whatever's around that's easy to consume. I don't have to sit down with a, I don't have to peel an orange, and I don't have to wash an apple and all that sort of thing, I just pick it up and eat it. I used to have a lot of nuts, and that helped keep my cholesterol down. I haven't been having as many nuts recently as what I used to. I used to have a day job where I can't be peanuts. Oh no, it was almond cashew walnuts, walnuts. They're really good walnuts here. I knew the ones that helped keep the cholesterol down so I would eat those. But I had a desk job and I could keep the nuts on the desk and I could eat them. I'm doing more manual work now, so it's hard to walk around with a pocket full of nuts and what it is to have butts in your desk. So that's part of the reason that the snacking has become different. You can have a packet of Tim Tams in the pantry for a month unopened but you opened and I, and I'll finish them off within a couple of days. So you know it's just, it is my lack of discipline. I went through this thing where I was slicing up apples and other fruit and having that just sitting in a plastic tupperware. And that made it easier, you know, to grab a bit as I was going. But you know, laziness, I fell out of that habit. Sounds like you'd really like me to do on that. Not the ascentic but the other patide, no, it's an option. I do appreciate it it's expensive. I guess, putting it into context though, I mean, I want my lifestyle, you know, we eat out like once or twice a week, we'll have takeaway. I didn't do that, I could easily afford. I'm 70, I haven't changed yet. What's the likely to be to make those changes and so sometimes.00:15:00 - 00:20:00Doctor: We start with blood pressure. I'm going to make another appointment with you to see about this, um, I think you've got trigger thumb. Yeah, and then if that doesn't work, do you do that here?Patient: Oh yeah, I can give you a referral to just get it done over radiology place. It might be easier. My son <REDACTED PII> works at um, <REDACTED>, and because he's a staff member there, I can get treatment a discount or for free. Yeah, is there a possibility of seeing someone there or is it better places to go? OK. I had a tennis elbow, uh, an injection for tennis elbow at one stage, and they made it sound like, you know, a weird science that that um, that only the best can perform. I don't think I actually had it, but I was right on the edge. Could have been 10 years ago. Is metformin the um a drug that prevents people using things like, uh, eos?Doctor: Oh yeah, I can do them. It's a piece of piss, so easy. Technically speaking, the procedure, it's super easy. No, nowhere near that exciting. I mean, look, of course you can cock it up, but it's really not that hard. OK, so medication wise, blood pressure, cholesterol and I'll start you on the metformin. Were you officially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at some point? Doesn't really matter.Patient: Is metformin the drug that prevents people using things like EOs and antacids and? That's Enos. What's you know? Oh, it's a there's some drink to relieve.Doctor: No.Patient: So many stupid formulations of this.Doctor: You mean?Patient: Arginine.00:20:00 - 00:25:00Doctor: Yeah, so whatever's easier for you, but I suspect it'll be easier getting it and cheaper getting in it. More than the other place that will do a bulk build is vision radiology. I don't know what iMed will do for you. And I've sent you the scripts. No problems with your legs? Excellent. No worries, so, um, see how all that stuff's going in and out. I'll give you a blood test form. And we'll just check on how it's all going in about months. Have a think about whether you want to do anything. Um, have we ever done a calcium score for you? It's about 300 bucks and looks at to see if you've actually got clogging up in your. I mean, you're already on treatment, um, I suppose it'll dictate to them how excited you get? I mean, yeah. I'll give you a form, you can have a think about it. Um, the main use is for people who are not keen on starting things where if you're happy enough to start the additional benefits probably low, unless it shows I guess if it shows a really high, you know, we might push you along. Do you have any problems when you're doing your manual work, like do you get any chest pain or anything like that? OK, yeah. So we'll do the blood test in about 3 months, so I will do that, but.Patient: OK. Yeah, I just got them. Thank you. No, that'd be great, great. All right. No. Yeah, didn't have that done, he was good for her. Yeah I should do one at some stage. Ha. I don't get chest pain, no, but like I'm, I'm an asthmatic and I've always been out of breath easily, um. Symbicort if I'm, I'm doing, yeah, I'm on really, but that's been brilliant. Let's keep the authentic. Uh, like I'm, I'm more of a, I'm, I'm better with lifting weights and picking things up than I am with endurance. January? Anything else I need? Yeah. You. Thanks very much for all of that. It worked pretty well. But yeah, expensive."

And, uh, and then we'll just review you, uh, in a few weeks' time if it um doesn't improve. In the meantime, just on examination today, your pulse is 70 in sinus rhythm. Your blood pressure is 160 on 100, uh your uh chest sounds clear. They do sound to be bibasal crackles, um, and uh your JVP is not elevated, but you do look a little bit, uh, with a tinge of blue in your lips after having spoken to me for quite some time.

When I have really bad histamine intolerance, I feel so dizzy and completely whacked out, and then I measured my blood pressure and it was decently low. I feel like it was 80 over 60, I think. Sometimes it was even lower, like high 70s or 50s.

So I'm on like a loose histamine diet like I'm trying to eat as openly as I can because like you're not supposed to stay on it for too long because it's like you can get malnutrition, I think. So, um, I try not to, mostly the worst thing that I try to do is like eating leftover meat that's leftover after like. I usually eat it the next day. But even then it's probably not ideal. Um, but then I won't eat it like after that cause it's got too much histamine on it. And then I avoid like um processed meats and like aged cheese. Um, one the uh. Like vinegar. Um, like I've, I've been trying to eat those things here and there because I'm just like trying to open up my diet a bit more, but it, I just don't go by time, can be really tricky, um. Yeah, you might, you might find some trigger things more than the others. Um, is it like itchy eyes and yeah, really, really itchy eyes. Um, really stuffy sinuses. Um, asthma? Um, just like the general, uh, struggling, not struggling to breathe in like a really drastic way, but like my nose is blocked and I have asthma, so it's quite um. Yes. Oh, sorry, yeah, I forgot about that. I also use a cream, so like uh. And I'm on Simbi court preventer. Um, yeah. Uh, I feel like when my asthma is that bad, nothing works, it helps a bit, but nothing like gets rid of it instantly when it's that bad, but I mean, I'm probably not the greatest at taking prevents and stuff like regularly. Oh, I also take Demita, sorry, forgot about that as well. Taking things regularly can be hard sometimes because I. Hey, but yeah, so. But I do. Yeah, it doesn't like it helps a little bit. Like when I feel really, really bad, I'll take to Nurofen, a Sudafed. Do my nose spray and my ass will pop up. And an antihistamine. And like that usually Sudafed helps the most. That's why I think it is quite like related to my sinuses."

Is there one that does, is that like Nathan, all of them are slow acting because they're steroids that I take weeks to write like Do miss got an antihistamine in it as well, so it helps a bit for the really bad days, you can actually use like a Otravi or. The Sudafed sprays. The problem with those is if you use it for more than 5 days, it makes things worse.

So, anything else you get? Does it feel quite postural like if you stand up for a long time, do you notice your heart racing? Is it specifically when you're feeling quite allergicy? What do you consider yourself um, hypermobile at all? Did you have any cool party tricks as a kid, like, did you do the splits or I don't know? Someone's done the POTS test for you. So that's the thing, like you can because you're so allergic, you actually what's called extravasate. So it kind of you like leak out, um.

These days, it's so much better that I, I guess I, I mean, maybe it is, but I also get like I used to see it really like I couldn't open my eyes because there was so much like gunk like allergic conjunctivitis, but that is also around the same time that I started taking Ritalin, so I don't know if it was just like too much like histamine wise. I get quite dizzy. And just so sleepy. I just wanna take a nap and like, or I just like, oh, I'm just gonna lay down and then I fall asleep for hours. I always feel a little but not my best. Like I've definitely felt I haven't woken up feeling how I used to feel years ago for like 4 or 5 years, I don't reckon. Um, like, even like today, I don't feel too bad, but it was hard waking up and my sinuses feel like I just feel stuffy and brain fog is a massive one that I feel quite often. Yeah, sometimes, yeah, like I'll. I had that the other day at work actually. I was standing up for a while and I think I was quite allergic and I was just like my heart's racing and I felt dizzy and I was like I just was trying to like work with this guy. I was like I have to go sit down for a bit, like, I'll come back later. I think so, yeah. Oh yeah, my, uh, <REDACTED PII> said the other day that like this is goes too far and these go too far, but I don't know if it's like. It's only like in the hands, and I think he said wrists or something, but other than that, I don't think so. I get like joint pain, I think to do with when I'm allergic. OK, but not other times I have actually randomly. My whole life had like random aches or I'm just like, oh my gosh, that hurts so much. And then it goes away. And I don't know if that's. I think it's worse when I'm allergic, but I do think I might get that. I've always been quite stiff. I think in like my legs laced. The only thing, yeah, that people get disturbed by my thumbs being far back. I don't think they have. Wait, is the POTS on where you have to stand up and then sit down? It sounds familiar. I don't know if I ended up getting it done or I was just told. I got it. But then it's something that like you have all the time, or is it, could it be like from allergies? Like if I was having a good day and I did the tests. I also, every time I get a blood test done, they're like, oh you have your mast cells are through the roof. Is that the one that's like, if you're sick or allergic?"

Trinbao is the new one, which is really good. Because I once a day one, which is quite good too. That's easier, but this is new um. What's on different about it like. They're carrying extra medicine. Oh OK, so there's 3 of them instead of just 1. All right. And you need to qualify in order to be able to get it? Yeah, so you need to have the on maximum doses of symbicort with proper technique and still have hospitalisation on use of steroids. Have you needed oral steroids? Uh, for asthma.

I have actually have a little bit of that arm. I also get really bad acid reflux, sorry I forgot. When I was Googling that, just like suss out what it was. I like affects you at your stomach acid, so I wasn't sure if I suddenly got bad acid reflux because I used that, I had that, I think twice a day, and antihistamines twice a day the whole time I was in Europe, so like 4 months. Um, and then I think it's probably post then that I have had quite bad. Um, acid reflux and like when I go to lay down in bed or like I eat and then like, like my boyfriend touches my stomach. I'm like, oh my gosh, I got to burp and I feel so fascinating, like Bernie, yeah. Yes, I have. My dad has um silent reflux, and he has like some damage, but yeah, I had an endoscope and I think they said everything was old, um. But yeah, I don't, I don't, I used to get it very rarely and now I get it almost probably every single day, really. Um, and I also wonder if that affects my inflames my sinuses, like my dad has found that um. His sinuses get so inflamed to feel stuffy you can't breathe in the night if he eats like before bed. And then when he, he's on his like medication to stop the reflux, it helped his sinuses as well, um. But yeah, so. I don't know if the only reason that I've been is that did I think that H3 did help, but I wasn't sure if that was why. The acid refluxing started. Well, like at the moment, it's not too bad, but then like most of the last 5 years, quite constipated, like I would have to, if I didn't take my 5, like if I forgot my fibre for like a couple of days. I would just be like. I don't know how do I just go back constipated. Yes, strain probably most times. Taking the steps of the fibre that I take each day and remembering to do that does help. Um, or eating with a bunch of prunes. Um, but I generally just lean towards more on the constipated side. Oh yeah, like often little pellets, yeah, so you're probably do you have diarrhoea? Not always, but it is, I feel like on the whole most like often that was the case. Uh, he rarely, but I have had it like and. Like I used to get it a lot. It used to be either constipated or have diarrhoea when I had really bad histamine intolerance. But now these days. Not particularly no. Think about I had a very hectic day of eating like. Anything and like drinking or something as well, then I might have like, very very loose to maybe, maybe not fully liquid, but like quite, yeah. That way, that's what I know that I've been like, usually that's followed like before that I've been so allergic that like it's been like torch off like and I haven't been out of work because it's been so bad and then that will happen a couple of days later, so that is kind of rare because I try not to make something like that, but yeah."

Yeah, um, that sounds like if you're a bit constipated, um, so it's just slow moving and one of the things I want to check for is are you actually loaded up with poop, and that can feed your histamine cycle as well because if you've got a lot of poop stuck in you, the guts try to move it and it. They're quite sensitive, and if it's not moving, you're basically irritating all the cells and they will lose a whole bunch of serotonin and all this, yeah. So how constipated are you? Um, in grade your poop. Oh yeah, like often little pellets, so you're probably do you have diarrhoea? um like watery diarrhoea?

                            "text": "Doctor: Well how high are we talking? Initial reading will be 150/90, and then, you know, after relaxing you to come to about 138/85. Nice. That's, that's, you know, that's the highest I've ever seen. And probably some cholesterol tablets too. They're all heading kind of in the wrong direction. Uh, just increasing cholesterol and probably the big one is triglycerides? Uh, and you're heading towards diabetes as well. The HBA1C doesn't change, well, it lasts for 3 months, so it's not something which changes rapidly. Um, and it's been heading up since last year. So I think that's a trend. And then you had your colonoscopy. Is he doing anything about it? So he's going to see you again or what's my first? It's really unclear because like actually says high grade dysplasia. Which I don't like, that means that they are getting weirder. Like this, this isn't, you know, it's just a significant polyp to remove the colonoscopy. It doesn't say what else he wants, sir. What he wants to do about it. Because sometimes when you go to like the high grade range they want you in yearly. I'll email it as well because that's kind of, it's like pretty useless freaking letter. I mean, it's low grade, I'd be much less excited. So hi, so basically he goes low, medium, high cancer. Alright, so you're right, that's just like, oh, so some people like, no, we're gonna do this yearly until we're clear, some people are like, yeah, I just want to.Patient: Um, I am kind of wound up at the moment, so you want to do it, do you want to do it 24 hour? I don't think it's gonna prove anything that we don't already know. OK. I mean, you were considering, you said to be seriously considering blood pressure tablets. I think I do need them. Well, I was diagnosed as type 2 diabetes years ago. Um, and I was able to sort of keep that under control, but like I said, when I had those tests, I was, I was being really bad. I'm still not real good. In the report that I got, he said he found 5 polyps, I think it's a whole bunch they were uh they weren't a major concern. But um, and he didn't give me a, a another appointment to come back in 2 years, but, I presume that it's ongoing for my age. Yeah, when he spoke to me after the procedure, he seemed pretty relaxed. And the time before, uh, we found some larger polyps and he was, he seemed a little more concerned then, so. I, I contact these officers and find out. Yeah, I just took these kind of relaxed tone after the procedure that day wasn't too concerned. Um, and that, um, what he was writing in the letter was, credible standard for someone my age with my history. Hm, kind of what his history, you know, you know, my mum had um bowel cancer and that uh she was, theatre an operation for that um. So he's, he's, you know, well aware of family history.00:05:00 - 00:10:00Doctor: Heading well towards the diabetes, metabolically syndrome sort of thing. I think we should do something about that. So, I think blood pressure is a good thing to do to keep your kidneys safe. Something for the cholesterol to try and kind of just get a lid on that. And then I guess the options for, so technically you're not diabetic. But you're heading that way and I guess in my mind, diabetes like the set cut off at 6.5 for HP once a year at 5.9. Normal is 5.5. But it's probably not good being in that middle; it's not like everything's fine and then everything. Yeah, so you're halfway, halfway to making an official either way I'm more likely to fall the wrong way. Almost certainly will go the wrong way. Yeah, so that's kind of an arbitrary cut off. So I'm pretty aggressive about it because it's just a heck of a lot easier early than it is later. The thing is you're accumulating damage that whole time. You know, it's not like suddenly everything's fine, then everything's horrible. Things are getting progressively worse; you've got the sugar running around gumming up your plumbing. So there's a few options ranging from kind of cheap to expensive. Cheap is like metformin, which is your baseline standard sort of drug. You don't have any evidence of like kidney injury or anything like that yet, so that's good. So I'd say probably that's not a bad option. The kind of deluxe option is one of those new weight loss drugs. So like aic or um to zepotide. The big thing about them is that they help you lose weight; we know that carrying weight is one of the risk factors of diabetes. Yeah, that's good stuff that if you can lose 10 to 20% of body weight, all the risks drop back down. And that's kind of what these drugs offer. Mhm. They're expensive and they're an injection; it's probably the downside of it. Cost is roughly 450 to 650 a month. So you're looking at about 100 bucks a week. It kind of depends. Like if you do a takeout or two, that kind of works out that ongoing for life doesn't have to be, so it kind of depends on you, really. I mean I can't afford a lifetime of it. Yeah, so kind of depends on how good a change we manage to make. You know, if you use it for a few months and you manage to lose 10 kg and lifestyle-wise we manage to get everything else under control, you know, then you can probably come off it. You will likely regain some, but like, and that's kind of why I quite like the medication is it actually gives you a chance. If you can lose a chunk of body weight and then make some good changes, diet, exercise, all that, which is often easier when you're carrying a bit less weight. You know, I've got a couple of guys around there, 140 kg, so they can't do any exercise. He has a catch 22; they need it and they can't do it. Yeah, so that's kind of what I see it's useful. Some people like they just can't and so you end up being on it for life, though I'd expect most people. Like, so I've been using, I use to Zappatide more because it's got more weight loss potential; they quote it up to 20% like it's huge. And often even just a smaller doses, which I think are only 360 bucks that it's cheaper, because it goes from 5 milligrammes, 2.5 milligrammes up to 15, 15 is 645 is cheaper. I've already had stellar success just fiddling around the 2.5s for guys who've lost about 10 kilos in 2 months.Patient: Yep. Right. Oh, I can't afford that. A month, yeah. I mean I can't afford a lifetime of.Patient: So anticipate they'll probably stay on.00:10:00 - 00:15:00Doctor: So anticipate they'll probably stay on for maybe 6 months maybe 6 to 12. One of the interesting things about these medications, most people report craving less food. Actually reduces that kind of. Is it a habit? I'd prefer you to have nuts and jerky and that sort of stuff. So they did a good study in Google, so it's the same thing because there's a policy in Google you can't be more than 30 metres from a snack. So the snack sections put in everywhere. Everyone can have diabetes and everything because I had like all the bowls of M&Ms and pretzels and all this stuff. I still want to give people a choice, but it is cool behavioural thing where they just put it under the table. All the soft drinks were behind opaque glass, you know, water was visible, Healthy snacks were visible and that actually makes a significant difference because fundamentally we're fairly lazy creatures, you go for the available. So one of the strategies is to just make it harder to get. There are also time lock saves you can get. So, you know, you can only once a day or. Yeah, um, so yeah, look, there's strategies like that, so like, you know, putting them in under some sort of, just makes it harder.Patient: My big problem is discipline. I know I eat badly. I eat well, but I know I eat a lot of sweet stuff as well. And I don't exercise as much as I should. You know, I'll go for walks but not, not uh, I might go for 5 in one week and then I do one for a week. So I know that routine item with the routine and I with the regular diet. I don't know, maybe if I lost. Mine's not even a craving, mine is like I'm a picker. I'll go past food, pick it up and eat it. And I'll pick up the stuff that I can eat with one hand, you know, I'll grab biscuits or a bit of cake or something like that, whatever's around that's easy to consume. I don't have to sit down with a, I don't have to peel an orange, and I don't have to wash an apple and all that sort of thing, I just pick it up and eat it. I used to have a lot of nuts, and that helped keep my cholesterol down. I haven't been having as many nuts recently as what I used to. I used to have a day job where I can't be peanuts. Oh no, it was almond cashew walnuts, walnuts. They're really good walnuts here. I knew the ones that helped keep the cholesterol down so I would eat those. But I had a desk job and I could keep the nuts on the desk and I could eat them. I'm doing more manual work now, so it's hard to walk around with a pocket full of nuts and what it is to have butts in your desk. So that's part of the reason that the snacking has become different. You can have a packet of Tim Tams in the pantry for a month unopened but you opened and I, and I'll finish them off within a couple of days. So you know it's just, it is my lack of discipline. I went through this thing where I was slicing up apples and other fruit and having that just sitting in a plastic tupperware. And that made it easier, you know, to grab a bit as I was going. But you know, laziness, I fell out of that habit. Sounds like you'd really like me to do on that. Not the ascentic but the other patide, no, it's an option. I do appreciate it it's expensive. I guess, putting it into context though, I mean, I want my lifestyle, you know, we eat out like once or twice a week, we'll have takeaway. I didn't do that, I could easily afford. I'm 70, I haven't changed yet. What's the likely to be to make those changes and so sometimes.00:15:00 - 00:20:00Doctor: We start with blood pressure. I'm going to make another appointment with you to see about this, um, I think you've got trigger thumb. Yeah, and then if that doesn't work, do you do that here?Patient: Oh yeah, I can give you a referral to just get it done over radiology place. It might be easier. My son <REDACTED PII> works at um, <REDACTED>, and because he's a staff member there, I can get treatment a discount or for free. Yeah, is there a possibility of seeing someone there or is it better places to go? OK. I had a tennis elbow, uh, an injection for tennis elbow at one stage, and they made it sound like, you know, a weird science that that um, that only the best can perform. I don't think I actually had it, but I was right on the edge. Could have been 10 years ago. Is metformin the um a drug that prevents people using things like, uh, eos?Doctor: Oh yeah, I can do them. It's a piece of piss, so easy. Technically speaking, the procedure, it's super easy. No, nowhere near that exciting. I mean, look, of course you can cock it up, but it's really not that hard. OK, so medication wise, blood pressure, cholesterol and I'll start you on the metformin. Were you officially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at some point? Doesn't really matter.Patient: Is metformin the drug that prevents people using things like EOs and antacids and? That's Enos. What's you know? Oh, it's a there's some drink to relieve.Doctor: No.Patient: So many stupid formulations of this.Doctor: You mean?Patient: Arginine.00:20:00 - 00:25:00Doctor: Yeah, so whatever's easier for you, but I suspect it'll be easier getting it and cheaper getting in it. More than the other place that will do a bulk build is vision radiology. I don't know what iMed will do for you. And I've sent you the scripts. No problems with your legs? Excellent. No worries, so, um, see how all that stuff's going in and out. I'll give you a blood test form. And we'll just check on how it's all going in about months. Have a think about whether you want to do anything. Um, have we ever done a calcium score for you? It's about 300 bucks and looks at to see if you've actually got clogging up in your. I mean, you're already on treatment, um, I suppose it'll dictate to them how excited you get? I mean, yeah. I'll give you a form, you can have a think about it. Um, the main use is for people who are not keen on starting things where if you're happy enough to start the additional benefits probably low, unless it shows I guess if it shows a really high, you know, we might push you along. Do you have any problems when you're doing your manual work, like do you get any chest pain or anything like that? OK, yeah. So we'll do the blood test in about 3 months, so I will do that, but.Patient: OK. Yeah, I just got them. Thank you. No, that'd be great, great. All right. No. Yeah, didn't have that done, he was good for her. Yeah I should do one at some stage. Ha. I don't get chest pain, no, but like I'm, I'm an asthmatic and I've always been out of breath easily, um. Symbicort if I'm, I'm doing, yeah, I'm on really, but that's been brilliant. Let's keep the authentic. Uh, like I'm, I'm more of a, I'm, I'm better with lifting weights and picking things up than I am with endurance. January? Anything else I need? Yeah. You. Thanks very much for all of that. It worked pretty well. But yeah, expensive."

And as you can see there as I'm talking here, you can see that you know, there's this transcription going on live in the background. As well on the left-hand side, right? So once I've received consent, I will obtain consent from the patient, then I just click on here and that'll be recorded, OK? And uh obviously there's no patient here at the moment, but when the patient's speaking, that will also show up on this side. And as you can see, it's not labelled like it's just, uh, you know, free text at the moment, doesn't say who the doctor is, what, what the doctor is saying, what the patient is saying, but that'll come later. Uh, and then so, uh, you know, uh, this is the scratch pad, you can put it whatever you want here as well. With this, you know that it's recording obviously because the text here, but you'll also see this recording flashing here to show that it's recording for you. And then also because you're going to be using an external mic, you might just, uh, uh, need to click on this for the Chrome setting on the on on the side here, OK, the microphone, see that? The other, the other indicator is also the red dot or the target shows that this is recording as well up here. Uh, so just, just if you're having recording issues, click on here and then you can click on the microphone setting. And then select the, you know, the microphone that that you're using if you have external microphone on there, OK. Uh, but if you have any, any problems then just let me know, uh, with that."

Um, just a couple of other questions we need to ask there. Um, do you smoke? Much in the way of alcohol? So, um, normally at this stage I'd like to, uh, that's OK, but so, um, but, but have listened to your stories, uh, I think, uh, just to recap you for the last few days you've been having loose stools, diarrhoea, a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left hand side, uh, like vomiting and weak lethargic. Um, you mentioned you have this Chinese takeaway as well as 3 days ago, and I wonder where that might be cause you problems, OK, it seems like you may have something, uh, called gastroenteritis, right? Which essentially took the tummy bug or infection of the tummy, uh. Mainly caused by viruses that they can be bacteria, uh, causing your symptoms. Yeah. At this stage, uh, what we recommend is just conservative management, so I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just to make sure you're well hydrated, and drinking fluids. Uh, there are things like Dier like get the pharmacy, which helps replenish some of your minerals and investments, um, and if you all have vomiting or diarrhoea, I would say recommend that first, you know, first couple of days. Yeah, it's often feverish and weak, you're taking some paracetamol, uh, type of times a day for the first few days can also help. I would certainly advise you to take some public work actually. I know you're quite keen to work, um, I would say next 2 to 3 days, um. A place with your system takes some time of rest, um, if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in 3 to 4 days, I'd like to come back and see you again. If it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else called symptoms, and we may need to do further tests like uh taking salt with your stool so you can test that.

                            "text": "Doctor: OK, sorry, don't know what was happening. What can we do for you?Patient: Um, Doctor <REDACTED PII>, be put in his house about a month ago. So put weight on it, blowing up quite a bit of fluid in it and she sent me for an X-ray.Doctor: So which foot?Patient: Left foot. Ultrasound, um. So nothing other than information of the um. Yeah, the of the uh around the ankle. Um, I was on pretty much on crutches persisted, um, wasn't didn't do what I was getting any better. Resting elevation. A week later when my regular GP, <REDACTED PII>, she, he, where's she at? <Redacted> ? I. Yeah. Um, by then my foot and actually whole-footed blow up of this man or I couldn't bend my toes.Patient: So before it might be gout, so. She put me straight on to this line. And been on that for 10 days, I just finished tapering that today. And didn't fix the well all the swelling went down, but it didn't fix the prime micro. Only got crutches about a week ago.Doctor: So, OK.Patient: Um, or is that the first time, last Friday was probably the first day I was actually able to put sort of weight on my foot and not have a lot of discomfort, you know, without using the crutches, um, and, and then on with the, you know, been happening the regular physio, but my Achilles was really sore. Um, and, and then for the past week it's been alternating between, my ankle's really sore, like I can't pivot or um, you know, you know, if I try to do it like that position, it really hurts him in the ankle joint and, and then next day went and while Achilles are really sore.Doctor: OK, so tell me how, how did it start? Did it start with an injury or like sprained ankle?Patient: In the past I've had a history of tendonitis in my elbows, but for the past 2 years I've, I've been at <REDACTED PII> and pretty much, you know, gravy.Doctor: So just how did it start?Patient: Now it's, yeah, grand for I wouldn't go for a walk on the beach and, you know, when I got back, my foot was really sore. You know, and really, and then the next day I was struggling to put you back.Doctor: OK. So did it hurt while you were on the walk?Patient: It was uncomfortable. But you didn't, you don't think you rolled it.Patient: Now, it was actually when I set out to go for a walk, so I was a walk on the beach, you said? Do you normally walk on the beach?Patient: And then, you know, it's been in past and this issue about soft sand, you know, and with your bet, you know, and not um because that's why I think up 2 years. To basically strengthen all the muscles and make sure that issues. I tendonitis. That was the first time in a long time you know foot pain.Doctor: OK, but it wasn't too bad that day. And so overnight it got really worse.Patient: Yeah. Take a step back and I, I'm not sure if there's any, any connection whatsoever. I was diagnosed with osteoporosis and same patient I start on <REDACTED PII>. And that week was the first time I took the <REDACTED PII> on a Tuesday. Or ways on some discomfort. I didn't know what was realised what was happening, that was reaction to the <REDACTED PII> that my stomach was just really cramping, and then the next day, 2 days later, I started having more muscle aches and joint pain.Patient: And that persisted with the stomach cramps and joint pain for until the Friday. And also with a coincidence in the Saturday, I ended up with this foot pain. And it blow up from me. So whether it's coincidence, oh, I'm just having a month now.Patient: And all the side effects were tick, tick, tick. I had muscle pain, some cramps, stomach pain. It was pretty bad, I was unwell for a couple of days, basically, you know, took it on a Tuesday and ended up taking, uh, you know, Wednesday.Doctor: Shouldn't cause enoughritis though.Patient: Next day, the other thing, you know, we have physio and, and of course my regular physio <REDACTED PII> is not available because he's sitting down I see an alternative.---300,600Doctor: Yeah. Have you had any other jointty sort of pains or anything like that? So when, let's have a look at your, Oh, I'll get you take the other one off too. All right, let's you go for a bit of a walk. How does it feel first thing in the morning? So just within that day, does it feel good in the morning and then gets worse, or do you feel bad in the morning, gets a bit better, gets bad again? The best in the morning, so it's not particularly sore or stiff in the morning? Let's say you get up in the morning, do you find that you stop limping and then you unlimp? When it was swollen, where were you seeing the s? So, do this for me. Can you get your chart for the back and still get your knees touching there without any, OK, so that's not particularly sore? OK, come sit on the edge here. I, I really don't remember people's names. Can you tell me what, what we did for her?Patient: This which is entirely bouncy. You know, the way this is presented in might be, have you ever thought that it was a rheumatoid arthritis? I don't know. I mean, No, no, it's, you know, at the moment I'm, I've been trying the last few days to walk as normal as possible and just slow down. Um, but you know, just, uh. I feel like I can wake up and turn down and feel it, you know, straight away, and so it's been up and down. You know, and you know, today it's sort of. Probably start off a bit worse than maybe I'd say feels probably yeah, maybe the best in the morning and then if I overdo it. No. I mean, I can still feel that, you know, and I, and I get out and, you know, what's it gonna be tonight, get out of bed, go to the bathroom and thought, OK, is it, is it actually up or is it uncomfortable with my Achilles hurt today or is that the act of the what's being really weird, you know, it's just, and of course once, you know, depending on what happened, it's affected this foot too, because I'm not walking properly. You know, I mean it's been, been weird. Basically the last week. You know, the last week since I've got off current, you know, before that, I couldn't put any weight on it. I literally was, was getting out of bed in the crutches or having the stool I was using the support, yeah, um, you know, I had to go up to <REDACTED PII> and bloody work out outside I be on bloody crutches because every time I I like to drop just too uncomfortable. He said, all the fluid in here, but even in the last few days I've noticed that, you know, it sort of gets big. coffee at, at the end of the day I'm taking my shoes off. Elevate the feet through here. Uh, yeah, and I've been doing, I've been doing calf raises to, you know. Does that hurt? No. Um, up and down. You know, it depends on whether my Achilles is, is really hurting or not.---600,900Doctor: OK, so she's due for sutures out. OK. So, yeah, so is the dressing gown, it's like, do you want me to come have a look? OK, cool. OK, so you want me to come down? OK, thanks. Bye. Cool. Sorry, I just have to see someone downstairs. Just hang out here for a bit. I'll be back. OK, cool. Just hop up on the bed for me. This one, yeah. Was an operation or a cut? tendons don't tend to respond that quickly. Um, why on your tummy for me. This one?Patient: like. Yeah, so. Of this scar. OK. Yeah. I could feel that yeah yeah. more in the. The OK. I can feel the beat that you know like how bad, you know, because I started walking around sort of crutch the first time it's just like. Reading with the draw. To pivot, you know, just really catches them. And, you know, China. Uh, physio, um, inserts in my heel just to raise the heels a bit to try to. Press Achilles. Achilles is not sore. No, it's, it's really weird and it's because we just they doing more car raisers for the past week and I went back in the first time to Pia on Tuesday. And pull back on the whites on you. I was able to do rather than just calf phrases with the election, you can drop it. You've got full range, yeah, and you know, and after that, you know, um, that, that really helped really was the stretched and. heaps of vi.---900,1200Patient: Yeah, that hurts right in the back of the heel. Yeah, that's sort of wobbling, I can feel it, right? It feels like it's right in my ankle. So? Yeah, but the outside of the ankle's OK. It's fine. It's a bit of swelling that you got up. So what in the produce line, I would have thought, you know, 10 days on this I would have really, I mean, the amazing part was within 24 hours, my foot was, you know, I couldn't bend my toes. You know, really the swelling to completely be away next 48 hours and try to walk on it and that was still. You know, so yeah, it goes on, you know, I knew after about 5 or 6 days I thought no it's toilet paper, it's not gonna, it's not gonna fix it completely, so I know I can't keep on taking it. So I started tapering on Friday, Saturday. And so I finished completely, but I'll, I'll start taping, um, meloxicam again last night. No, no, it doesn't keep me awake when you've got weight on it. I'd say, you know, compared to where it was a week ago, it's, you know, it's 90%, you know, better, but it's just still that. The fact is that I will feel to get rid of the crutches last Friday, and here we are Thursday, so still not a week and they're still getting a little bit, it's up and down, that's the thing, it's sort of irritating that, you know, I just feel like, well, I don't feel like it the go and take the dog for a walk, you know, because I don't want to overdo it. Its affect the ankle? Okay, so not just the.Doctor: Heel, OK. I think it's probably worth looking at, you know, any inflammatory arthritis. It's not sleeping magic, but it took all the swelling away, that's, that's not bad. Yeah, so typically with an inflammatory arthritis to worse in the morning, so people were like sucks for a couple of hours, but then it kind of warms up, and the more I move it, the better it feels. So that's more of an inflammatory type process. Gout, to be honest, feels awful all the time. Crystal Laroppies just feel terrible all of the time. Yeah, typically it's only one joint though. I think that's probably not an unreasonable guess as to what went on. Do you have any psoriasis or anything like that? Any rashes? You've still got some swelling, particularly like so when I point your foot. You've got some swelling in the back of the ankle.---1200,1500Doctor: So I reckon where it's at is you've got some fluid in the subtalar joint. Your ankle joint is here, the subtalar joint is here. So your ankle joint is technically this one here, and then somehow they joined this here. It can swell out the back here, so let me point your foot. It gets kind of squashed. This is also the joint where you do that motion, and that can be what particularly walking on beaches can kind of irritate. As I suspect, either you had an inflammatory arthritis or like a gouty sort of condition. So you can get two types: there's uric acid and there's calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition diseases. If it's gout, you can treat it with allopurinol. It's only worth treating if you get it kind of regularly, more than three times a year. If it's like once a year, it's not worth it. Otherwise, it's just kind of do what you've done, like when you get it, just get on the steroids or something, use colchicine for a high dose anti-inflammatory. It will just suck for a while. You've got the crystals there anyway, and your body kind of happily ignores it, and then for some reason, it'll pick a day and just send all the inflammatory things there, and you get this massive swelling. It's often because the subtalar is deep. It's a hard joint to poke. We probably should do a screen of inflammatory markers to see if there is some sort of underlying inflammatory issue. We can do what's called a dual energy CT, which tries to identify if it's gout or calcium pyrophosphate. It uses a special CT machine that fires energy at different levels, and they tell you what sort of crystals they are. If it's calcium, then there's no point treating you for gout. If you're on the mend, it's probably not my choice to do anything more than just doing the anti-inflammatories. If you're walking okay, like if it's still really sore, one of the best things to do is actually stick a needle in it and inject it.Patient: Um, I just discovered all these people I know that I didn't know had gout, and they all got their own advice. One of them was that apparently a friend of theirs had kidney failure after allopurinol. Well, allopurinol, that shouldn't really happen. No, that's the thing when the thing said, you know, Doctor Walpole just doesn't, it's not hot. There was a little bit of redness, but it was more swelling in the ankle. I had something similar a couple of weeks ago. It's not here. Yeah, um, when I went into this thing, it was a reflection. We still.---1500,1800Doctor: Because when it's bad, it hurts so much that the thought of a needle going through that, everyone's like, yeah. Take a pass on that. Some of the red or a high dose anti-inflammatory which works best because it is a profoundly inflammatory sort of process. It'd be good to know which joint it is, um, and it's a bit trickier in the ankle because there's lots of joints, really easy on a big toe, but you probably need like an MRI early to know where the fluid is, so you know which joint to shove it in. That's big joints is not too bad, but again, no one likes it, um, but the fuel energy CT is pretty good. If it takes me 3 weeks? OK. It's not too unusual, but I mean with the 3 weeks on the crutches, and then probably you didn't get onto it early, so I guess the thing is if this happens again, is you want to get onto a high dose anti-inflammatories early. Or though yeah, if you've got osteoporosis, I try and keep you off credit. Now, I've got to say again and say there's not yeah, yeah, there's so you can either do it with like an IV infusion, so you can do like once a year IV. There's a few options, but the problem is if you've got crappy bones, Prednisone is not gonna help that. Topical steroids, uh, it depends on how much really and how often you're needing it. You've got chronic eczema, yeah, yeah. So it's just here and there like. Then yeah, there will be some absorption. Um, so yeah, probably the thing I'd suggest would be. Roxicam doesn't hit fast, that's my main issue, that's my main view for that. Doesn't be fast. It takes about 7 hours to reach peak. So it's not good as an on and off. It's good when you take it regularly. Meloxicam group is a last for ages, but it doesn't kick in quick, so it depends, but a lot of people find that like let's say they're really sore and they take it at night to try and get a better night sleep, it doesn't work. I feel great the next morning, doesn't help that night. If you want to do it on and off, I like either naproxen or um Celebrex or a 12 clock. Um, basically within an hour and they. Celebrates lasts 12 hours, naproxen lasts about 124. I'm quite happy to give you a script of one of those. Next week I'm happy with you on meloxicam, um, you can finish it off, but I guess the next time you kind of wanna hit it. The earlier you can get onto the anti-inflammatories, kind of the less horrible it is, I guess. So like, you know, when you start first few weeks. Get it into you.Patient: Even when it was like I couldn't put weight on her, it didn't hurt to poke. Well, yeah, no, yeah, it was blown up with a puppy and it was sore, you know, it's hard to put weight on it and walk on normally, but I must admit you know. Take a couple of for bloody great. Is the average for yeah, start on grand final day, so here we had too much getting on the 5 weeks. 12 days ago yeah about 2 weeks before. Yeah, I'm supposed to. I know it's supposed to be and I'm not prepared to take the actor. I'll talk about Actonel. Every once a month, once a week. That's part of the reason to osteo. Um, you know, I never thought that, um, topical ointments were an issue, but it's now that it is. Well, I got meloxicam 15 milligrammes. That's what I sort of was doing, and I, up and down depending on whether I was having issues with, you know, 100L but I normally would take it at night. Yeah, uh, that cause I think, you know, maybe for the next, next week to help settle down.---1800,2100Doctor: Do you have any problems with your guts? Do you have any problems with um ulcers or anything like that?Patient: No. No. Now, always make sure I take all my meds with food. Even though proof I make sure that you know on an empty stomach.Doctor: I like Etura Coxi. That's kind of like my favourite. The downside of this one is it's slightly more expensive, um, anti-inflammatory. So the thing is it won't help when you're safety net, so I think it ends up being about.Patient: I'd rather something that's more effective. Yeah, look.Doctor: So the other thing is, I guess all of the anti-inflammatories are a little bit individual. Some people react really well to one and not the others. There is this thing called the um Oxford pain chart where they've tried to rank all of them, and this usually comes out on top. So give it a bro, but if you find like it doesn't do anything, then we'll change it to naproxen or Celebrex.Patient: Sure.Doctor: Do you want a referral to get that CT scan?Patient: Um, you might as well, and then I can decide whether I want to use it or not.Doctor: Yeah, look, it's not gonna tell us anything kind of in the acute sort of setting, it's ready to go.Patient: I'll give it a week, you know, and if it's a thing of that, you know, persisting and I feel like, OK.Doctor: Yeah, look, it's not gonna tell us anything kind of in the acute sort of setting, it's ready to go. I don't know how well it works if it's not particularly pissed off.Patient: OK, so it needs to really identify.Doctor: Probably be more in the kind of pissy sort of state. And then, and like I said, it kind of tells us which way.Patient: Um.Doctor: So it's kind of if we're getting to the point of considering, like we're going to treat you for gout, I guess.Patient: Um.Doctor: It can be school to know to make sure that it is in fact gout. I'll do some bloods as well.Patient: Yeah, I'm due to have blood tests because I've been on vitamin D trying to address some issue with my thyroid response. So we on vitamin D supplements for 2 months and I do that blood test.---2100,2400Doctor: Um. OK. Uh, what's your endocrinologist's name? So, a bunch of blood tests, it'll also look at some of the weird stuff that can happen with risedronate, your bisphosphonate. So we'll kind of help with some of the weird stuff that happened with that and calcium metabolism. Um, this is the dual GCT. No worries. So you go to Keyser, that's right. So Doctor <Redacted> is your endo. Um OK. I'll send a letter to your GP Dr. <Redacted> , and <Redacted>  on planning on doing, um, you should have got the script for your anti-inflammatory um. This one. You can just add them into whatever they're looking at. Um, so yeah, take both in so we don't double up. We don't need 3 vitamin D tests. So yeah, are in that. We'll get better. But yeah, next time you get the first sign of it, just like chopped out some anti-inflamm.Patient: <Redacted> . Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh. Right, uh, cool. Oh yeah. All right, so I, I'll get the blood done, uh, I sort of follow up on the vitamin D that way. Yes, it's a lot of um uh vitamin D as well, so. It's funny, you know, like obviously you don't actually feel like it's loose in the ankle. Yeah, I do a lot.---2400,2700Patient: It's not uncomfortable stepping on it.Doctor: Yeah, feel we get so yeah my foot did something like a couple of weeks ago just like. It occasion that I enjoy, you know. Yeah, I just."

Initial management included rest, elevation, and the use of crutches. An X-ray and ultrasound were performed, revealing fluid around the ankle but no fractures. The patient was treated with a course of steroids for suspected gout, which reduced swelling but did not fully resolve the pain. The patient has a history of tendonitis in the elbows and osteoporosis.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Assessment:</h4>\n  <p>Physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling in the left ankle, particularly in the subtalar joint. The patient reports alternating pain between the ankle and Achilles tendon, with symptoms worsening throughout the day. There is a suspicion of either inflammatory arthritis or gout, given the patient's history and symptomatology. A dual energy CT scan is recommended to differentiate between gout and calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Past Medical History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Osteoporosis</li>\n    <li>Tendonitis (elbows)</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Family History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Social History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Medications:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Meloxicam 15mg as needed</li>\n    <li>Vitamin D supplements</li>\n    <li>Risedronate (Actonel) for osteoporosis</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Allergies:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Investigations:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>X-ray of left foot - Fluid around the ankle (date not specified)</li>\n    <li>Ultrasound of left foot - Findings consistent with fluid accumulation (date not specified)</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>I would greatly appreciate your clinical review and assessment, and any ongoing management that you may consider necessary.</p>\n  <p>Kind Regards,</p>\n</body>",

We're still working on the system. So what can we do for you?Patient: I'm always just like I say I have a bit of a um, yeah, OK. <Redacted> is a very complex, um, physical and mental health and quite a few um things that we just wanted to run through today to bring you up to speed on the complete situation. There's a few things that we need to get a formal diagnosis for. This is very superficial level what I'm saying right now, but looking to get a couple of things like just some clarity around what's going on for date and some treatment options. She needs a full medication review, um, so needs to link in with the psychiatrist. I'm sure you know what the wait times are like and trying to get in with one at the moment, so, but it's been how many 5 years was it since you had a.Patient: I was there. One of the uh last time I had. And when it was December last year, but it's not really, yeah, but I like it so I, I suppose um the initially like your name came up, um. Even in the context of like I have chronic pain and I have um. Then the pain clinic and from them and then other like all have sort of brought up about um ES and the hyper hypermobility, um, and I've previously been a client at Zebras, um, Australia, um. Pre-pandemic times and stuff, um, and yes, like I don't, I don't even know. Um, and then also like fatigue has been like an ongoing thing.Patient: If it's like fatigue that is chronic or if it's chronic fatigue syndrome, um, I've had like various different tests I did was I going through like pathology that I um have had like over years and I found um one that uh. Sorry, it's a bit rays. Um, and I just printed out all the ones that are from this, but it's like it is from 2021, but um the my GP at the time was like, no, everything was normal, but it did come up with um the the anti-gastrictus. I was this.Patient: And yeah, and I'm just like, oh, that sort of potentially is what I have had like sleep changes done and that's all like everything is like. Um, borderline. Like it's like, oh, you did not narcotic. You don't have breast sleyrome it's like it's all very, yeah. On like, you know, like, yeah, um, I have been diagnosed with FMD, um, and that was the, the episode started back in 2020, um, and I was diagnosed in 2021, um, and the neurologist.Doctor: Um, so probably there's a few things going on. So why do we start with what diagnosis have you got?Patient: OK, um, so. Uh, um. OK. Um, so I was pain wise, I was diagnosed with CRPS in 2013. Um, when I fractured my left tubula. Um, it, it and at dance, um, and then fracture your left fibula. I was doing te on point and I was.Patient: And then um, it was sort of poorly manage, but even from the initial like, the pain wasn't close to the fracture side, it was contagion like my knee and and and my ankle, but it was dancing around and everything, um, and now this is like, because it's.---300,600Patient: Break, the pain wasn't close to the fracture side, it was contagion like my knee and my ankle, but it was dancing around and everything, and now this is like, because it's spread. To every day like oh it's fibre but maybe see I like it, so that's a bit unclear. I was recently diagnosed with POTS or the cer tolerance, the cardiologist sort of put tops on them. He's like officially written off having tolerance.Doctor: Who's your cardiologist? Doctor <REDACTED PII> at um the average. To be honest, it doesn't matter whether it is or isn't. It's just POTS is an extremely narrow thing. So if your blood pressure drops, it's not hot.Patient: Yeah, yeah, like blood pressure doesn't seem to drop but the most recent, like the 24 hour blood pressure thing, I was hypertensive like previously there was like more normal tensive but high heart rate. So we've been put on a sort of initially put on propranolol, TDS, but that hasn't seemed to like helped but not a whole lot.Doctor: We can get on to me, so let's do diagnosis first, so I've got, so there's a chronic pain component which is either CRPS or fibro.Patient: Yeah. Um, and then the fatigue has just been written as chronic fatigue. Further from that.Doctor: When did that start?Patient: Look, I feel like it was before like the pain and before like the injury, but it's definitely worse in the night like. I honestly, I don't even really know like it, yeah.Doctor: When do you think it started becoming a problem?Patient: I sort of like I used to work and I'm not, I'm just starting to work again, but even when I was working it was like I was able to and then I was like crashing afterwards, but that was like also the pain and everything, it's sort of hard to sort of tease it out, but I feel like maybe like 2019.Doctor: OK. And then, anything else? I've got chronic fatigue, we've got a question of maybe hypermobility, got an FND. Like, how does that manifest?Patient: Sometimes it's just like one limb or a combination or like the whole body. Yeah, I like between like 30 minutes to 2 hours, but the longest it's gone on for is like 6 hours time and 5 hours in another. And yeah, it's just sometimes I can sort of feel it coming on and then other times it's just like I just, you can't.Patient: Yeah, and, and it's like sometimes you get like fatigue attacks and is that the FA is that? Chronic fatigue and that's like the fatigue attacks like. I just all of a sudden I can't like hold myself upright, but I can move.Doctor: So what does the paralysis look like in that?Patient: Yeah, it just won't respond to you doing things or you yeah like I feel like it's kind of like Matilda and I'm like I'm looking at like my limb and I'm like move and I can't.Patient: As it's like starting to come good or like back online, it's, I'll get, um, also sometimes it's sort of like a muscle twitch and trying to like capitalise on that and there'll be sort of pins and needles, and then pain and then numbness. And then it's in the cycles through that, and then I'm able to.Patient: Initially they thought it was hemiplegic, but that didn't really because it wasn't basil migraines, which I do get migraines, and so they thought this is like a focal element of migraines.Patient: I did have the genetic test? No.Doctor: Well, I suppose you keep swapping side to side like just an arm, sometimes it's like, like neck down, and then it's like, yeah, like one will come back.---600,900Doctor: Well, I suppose you keep swapping side to side like just an arm. It never affects breathing or anything like that. Who's your neurologist? Dr. <Redacted> or?Patient: Sometimes it's like neck down, and then it's like, yeah, like one will come back online or like no, no. My older brother, but he, yeah, back in 2021, after the diagnosis, he said that there wasn't anything seriously neurologically wrong with me and I didn't need a neurologist, just more psychology. Um, and then I haven't really had a whole lot of treatment in that area since.Doctor: How often do you get them?Patient: Um, I haven't, they've been further and further apart and more sporadic. There was like a period of time where it was pretty regular, like every 3 to 4 weeks it was sort of happening and I was keeping a diary and trying to identify potential triggers and things for it. But yeah, I feel like I've had like a handful this year, which in previous years it would have been a lot higher.Doctor: So this year maybe?Patient: Well, I mean, like I'm, yeah, I feel like it's been a reduction in various different potential triggers. I don't know, I don't know.Doctor: So how many have you had this year?Patient: Um, do you reckon? It's October now. But 5 or 6, yeah.Doctor: When was that diagnosed?Patient: That was diagnosed while I was in hospital for my mental health. They sort of first saw me back in March 2023.Doctor: OK. So restless legs or not quite?Patient: No, like, yeah, I think so. Why are we getting sleep studies? Like I was falling asleep, staying asleep, but waking up exhausted. Sometimes I wake up and I feel more tired than I did at the end of the previous day. Yeah, there was exploring that and I think also there was kind of like with the FND was that epilepsy with cataplexy.Doctor: OK. Where did you get reviewed for that?Patient: Monash, like Monash health. Yeah, um, and like the migraines and such. I did recently go back to the optometrist and I've been trying to explain like with my eyes for a while, but yeah.Doctor: OK.Patient: More recently, the right eye, like the eyeball itself is really painful and that will sometimes lead to a headache, migraine, and everything. That also leads to like there's like a couple of teeth up here. I've had all of my losing teeth removed and sometimes it feels like it's like that wisdom teeth pain, but they're not there, so you know, but they said it's fine. But yeah, and like the sort of double vision and a visual snow.Doctor: And you brought up the visual snow numerous times over the years?Patient: Yeah, and it's sort of been dismissed and like said oh it's like part of migraines and such, but it's there all the time. It's not like an aura of a migraine.---900,1200Patient: Numerous times over the years and it's sort of been dismissed and like said oh it's like part of like migraines and such, but it's there all the time. It's not like an aura of a migraine.Doctor: OK, so the visual snows all the time.Patient: Yeah, yeah, um, and with the vision and the visuals so like so I'm, I started working with the neuropsychologist and she, we sort of like came up and she's like that not a normal ongoing, so that should be investigated, um, but my GP just said to go to the optometrist, but the neuros I had questions whether I needed to see a morta. That hasn't really gone anywhere.Doctor: Who's in your side?Patient: Uh, Ma, mango stuff um M A G M A N.Doctor: Yes, that's a second part to it.Patient: I'll collect it. It was uh. And uh, yeah, um, well, the initial MRI like showed a little abnormality it didn't really show up on it printed it, but um, and they recommended that a whole lot, but the neurologist in the end didn't. I think so, but then, um, your psychologist felt like that could potentially be a good idea, and I have had like, I've known it comes in and I keep my head sometimes, um.Doctor: And with um.Patient: Yes, and yeah, like it was like sort of oh yeah just like the, the ringing in my ears as well, like.Doctor: It's a pulsatile. It's an omic pulse or not. No.Patient: No, but with my vision, sometimes that is like my pulse, like I don't know how to like it's the visual service sort of like. Not all the time, that's not all the time, but um.Doctor: When do you get the double vision?Patient: So it's, yeah, like with migraine or does it happen sometimes, so it's kind of like it's like um. Like there's, it's always something that's like slightly like double. Sort of all the time, but it's like um, they said that it was like my brain is like having to.Doctor: Not emerging appropriate.Patient: Yeah, and so like as the day goes on or like I'm more fatigued, it's, it's a lot worse. And then the eye pain worse.Doctor: Um.Patient: And yeah, and the, the blurry and then it's like I have to like. Think of like trying.Doctor: Can you do it?Patient: Yeah, yeah.Doctor: OK, and other diagnoses, so you were in hospital for mental health.Patient: So yeah, PTSD and um I was in the treatment of like um EMDR, which I had previously tried in the moo my psychologist and I had within 24 hours, I had two of the <REDACTED PII> episode, so then it was like not in the community, um, and then in hospital I haven't been able to do India. Um, and it's sort of, I keep getting handled to. Like I couldn't get any more help from the pain clinic until I dealt with my trauma and so then try to do that, but then it makes sense you need to sort out like your FNB and like dissociation and FND was like. Trying to find it. It's been some ongoing.Doctor: So they tried doing EMD in in hospital that didn't work.Patient: Didn't even get to the sort of active phase of um.Doctor: What happened?Patient: I was having um more frequent um that the process like while I was in there I had like a 6 hour, I was like on.---1200,1500Doctor: Yeah, OK, um, and was the PTSD related to like medical trauma or, how does that kind of manifest?Patient: I am, yes, I'm no longer working in like a hospital setting. I do have some workplace trauma, but there's like other things. It's more so what that.Doctor: What do you avoid?Patient: I don't even really sort of know, like I'm like I feel like it's sometimes like the world sort of gets sort of quite small, but recently, like my grandpa was in hospital, a hospital that I used to work at and I couldn't go.Doctor: Are there other things you avoid like driving or going outside?Patient: No, um, yeah.Doctor: OK, anything else?Patient: Recently diagnosed with um, yeah, with um autism and ADHD, only diagnosed like it started 2023.Doctor: Anything else?Patient: Um, in inside.Doctor: Is that better explained by?Patient: Yeah, I don't know, it's like, like even the, the, this is she was like, I feel like we could sort of cross off some of your diagnosis, but I, because that's what they called me because I don't like it, yeah.Doctor: Common, I mean, where is one at the other?Patient: I guess it's it's like it's just because I've been on so many different um antidepressants, partly because, uh, the nerve pain, the treatment like antidepressants, anti-rotic meds, um, and yeah, not, not being effective, um. And like I've had TMS and things like that.Doctor: Anything else?Patient: Um, I just like, yeah, that's sort of like the coat hanger pain, um. And just, yeah, like sometimes like that sort of build up will like lead into migraine, but by the time I don't know it's just. Yeah, and like sometimes it's like just like my head feels so heavy like and I, and like just is that fatigue, is that like, I don't know.Patient: I think one of the things because I don't know if you're going to say it and I feel like it needs to be said. Um, one of the reasons that I've come along today with <REDACTED PII> is because there's um been quite an incredible history of medical practitioners not actually listening and obviously you are and it's beautiful to see um listening to what her experiences are, um. Whether they may you know regardless of the outcome of things, I think you felt like you've really been invalidated and dismissed quite a lot and what's going through this very exhausting list of everything that's going on for her. Um, I just wanted you to be aware that that's an experience that's been, it's taken an awful lot for her to come here today and speak with you and share.---1500,1800Doctor: It's been, it's taken an awful lot for her to come here today and speak with you and share and, yeah, so just in case you weren't planning on saying that it's something that I've worked with <REDACTED PII> for a wee while now and just seeing this cycle of building up to come and see her. Like with someone and for it to just be, oh, that's just anxiety or, oh, it's just that. So firstly, from my end, thank you for listening to her. Um, but I just wanted to say sorry, unfortunately we know that at least 85% of people with this sort of stuff has medical trauma, so that's probably an underestimate. So yeah. Um, OK, so can you tell me I guess who's in your healthcare team at the moment? So who's your GP? Who's your cardiologist? Do you still see them? Yes. >Redacted> lost interest. It supports person doing anything for you? Are they gonna see you again? OK, cool. I don't know how. Did you do did you tilt table? No, no. Do we do the nasalline, the thing where you lean against the wall for ages? No, OK.Patient: I'm looking for education. Um, I don't know that you, um, not an ongoing sort of GP. So, um, yeah, but I think we've got a couple of options to try like the most recent. Yeah, anyway, I had a brought up any, it was like I've been referred and everything, um, and he's like pops is in a thing like probably like and then like then he's like all this then he did like stuff like my blood pressure and stuff it's like static intolerances, but everybody has it, and I know that, you know, there is, when you stand up like their body is having to. But everyone, but yeah, um, but then supposed to normalise. Um, but then he prescribed medication. Um, just did uh. Um, just sits down. Yeah, yeah. Um, and, and the the whole thermometer and. And then he did do the echocardiogram, um, and he did also do some bloods that it was like a loop in something or other, um, just like some of the chest pain and, and, and yeah. His paternal grandpa like he did, he did run like it was like a liard or something or other, which is like a newish. Um Blood like pathology, which turned out to be fine anyway, but just seems like there is like a some, yeah, cool.---1800,2100Doctor: OK. Um, who else? So? So who diagnosed you with ADHD and autism? Was that through a psychologist or did you have a full?Patient: Uh, don't currently have a psychiatrist. I, yeah, there's that and this is my ears I feel like transcended it for me. Mhm. That, yeah, they didn't, uh, that's for ADHD, but then she referred to it in the thing and then my neuropsych was like, as I told her she's like, um. And, and I have been on I can't bets. And yeah, like the previous psychiatrists have like questioned it I mean and I didn't really want to hear like a previous psychiatrist back in 2018 brought it up, but I was not ready to hear that at the time. Yeah. Well, I my script has run out and I don't have a um psychiatrist, so I was rationing them and then and then um have yeah, no, been taking them. Um It's been interesting. Yeah, but then recently like sort of comparing the this and and and I didn't take one of my like I have 4 remaining, um, and that day like, um. I noticed like my heart rate like went up to 178 like on like normally like it it's like it is elevated but not that high, and it was sustained for like not. For about 25 minutes or so, um. And like, yeah, what I took to help bring it down but it was more elevated that day. So I feel like maybe that's not. The right medication or stimulants in general, I'm not sure. This is a recent thing so like previously it's like when I was on it like more so like when I was like one day and then not and then taking it again like. And there was like I could feel sort of anxious sort of sort of middayish like. Onward and then it sort of would come down again, and I was like, oh maybe it's just because I'm doing things and I'm like able to and I'm running around and like that's, you know, I'm not pacing myself and, and, and I've not been able to do things and now I can do things and worry about it like not get all things done, but I think like maybe potentially part of it was also. The heart rate being elevated. I don't know.Doctor: It's always tricky, because they kind of crank your heart rate and it ends up being up to you really as to whether the benefit of the stimulant outweighs the heart rate sort of stuff. OK. Um, do you know which stimulants were you on? Uh.---2100,2400Doctor: OK. So I guess one of the things to think about is we've got a few other GPs here. The advantage of that is all the notes will be kind of shared. So that might be an option.Patient: Um, do you know if like any of the GPs, um, I have a prescribed stimulant? Yes, yeah, yeah, most of them do, and I do anyway, and once the clinic has it, you kind of then you're kind of fine. OK. Um, generally, like, I mean they can still refuse, but they usually don't think most Supreme Court, yeah. OK, so what medications are you on?Patient: Um, in the morning, I am on 250 milligrammes of lithium, and that was for the depression, not bipolar. 150 mics of clonidine, and that's for the nightmares. How are you tablet? And then, yeah, in the morning I was taking 5 minutes, but I'm not really anymore. And then I was taking propranolol TDS, 60. Um, that 50 seem to.Patient: Oh, I kind of, so yeah, 60. The last one. Um, and then, and then I just take um, like the Metamucil, and then if I remember a multivitamin. Um, and then so, yeah, I was on the 10 milligrammes of propranolol TDS and then I was told to come off the propranolol and replace it with the I I um, and I don't remember what dose that was, maybe 40.Patient: That was either TBS or BD. I can't remember. OK, so do you take that in the evening or in the afternoon? I took it a couple of days and I got really bad chest pain, um, both of those days, so I have not taken any more. Um, and then the Martin. And I'm not sure what dose that is overt in half, so it's a 4 milligrammes I'm taking a 2 milligrammes.Doctor: OK, that's probably not enough.Patient: Yeah, and that was like I was taking, I tried doing that TDS and then with the propranolol because the ibuprodine was supposed to replace the propranolol, but I couldn't do the. But then when I did that, I was just really dry even though I was drinking more and trying to keep up with sort of.Patient: Yeah, and like even like my eyes are like more dry. Like waking up like just. Um, so I've, at the moment. I've not been really back of my cardiac and it's not been great, especially as more. But typically I'll take half of the Marrogen and then uh the propranolol taus.Patient: So the half margin in the morning and then um, and then or you're not doing it? I am doing it, that's what I'll do. Sometimes it's like sort of I forget because I'm sort of at the routine of it, but also it's sort of like when I do that for a few days and then I start to feel like it just feels very drying and then it's.Doctor: That's unusual.Patient: Um, I did.Doctor: And so you also taking propranolol?Patient: Yeah, and, and I will take the propranolol for sure at night because I dispense it in a dosset box with all of those ones, um, and then the morning of the day is we just kind of.Doctor: You find the propranolol is helpful?Patient: Um, it makes a difference, but my heart rate is still typically like when.Doctor: Does that worry you?Patient: Um, no, it's more like when it's sort of consistently in like the 120s. Also, like when I'm sitting or like.---2400,2700Patient: Also, like when I'm sitting or like just, I'm not like actively like doing things, um, and I can feel like the heart palpitations and things, I just know that the heart can't really sustain that. Yeah but like it does, it does like go up to like the 160 and things like that and like, um, yeah, and the sort of presyncope thing and I have heard it a few times, um. I mean, I think it's, I think that's in with like the pots is like the sort of, it's not shortness of breath, it's like increased work of breathing, like where it just like it, it becomes, it's like a very manual thing but also it just is really exhausting, um, and I don't know if that's fatigue or I don't know. Yeah. Sometimes, yeah. Yeah, um. And it's like when I've been sitting down and then like I stand up and it's just like, oh, I feel like going down like, um. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, on the, on the days that it's. But, um, and it's like, it's kind of like, you know, you take the dog for a walk and like how do you still have to sort of, yeah, it's not like it's necessarily like I'm avoiding a lot, but yeah. Um, I feel like I was keeping track of like for a period of time the years like days where like I was like 8 or 9 times in in in the day, yeah. I have a whole document of medications that I have tried and have not worked that I did not bring with me. I also, I, um, it's good to know so we don't double up. Yeah, psychiatrist that was prescribing the stimulant medication, she just kept this done the like the. Uh, but I am not a parent, um, rizatriptan, like Maxel is 10 milligrammes, and, uh, which one is that rhizotriptan. Uh, I feel like the headaches and like daily, near daily, and migraines are like, I put it like 4 times a week. Um, but like really bad ones, uh, like where it's like the, the, the nausea and photophobia and like I have to wear sunglasses in the house. It's like. You want to like 23 weeks, like once every 23 weeks or so. No, that like I, so I'd seen. Yeah, I, I think. No, I haven't. Um, I could send it to you. It's just like it's not complete and I tried because I, I do you want me to write something? No, I'm just joking. Oh thanks. Um, because I sent it to me just in case it came up. Um. Cause I, yeah, but like I did a document of like the CRPS timeline and all of the healthcare professionals I've seen that, and then I started doing like a healthcare timeline of like. And then I did a head to toe assessment on myself and I did not put the medications in here, um. I said type of crazy. All you're doing that there's someone else on the care team as well, um, I'm not sure if you need a mental health occupational therapist.Doctor: So you don't have to worry too much about the heartbreak being fast in terms of your heart, you're young. Your heart can kind of deal, but probably once you get to like 160, 170, it's probably inefficient. And so that's why you can get the things and it's an unpleasant sort of feeling, um. OK. Any other medications that you are currently taking or you have tried and didn't work? Have you seen a migraine neurologist? Really good to get that list of things that have been tried.Patient: I messia Antonio, is that right?---2700,3000Doctor: I messia Antonio, is that right? Yeah, cool. Uh, is there anyone else? I'm just thinking. That's.Doctor: Yeah, so, so who are you seeing to maintain all these medications, or is it just a specialist you don't have a.Patient: Um, yeah, so yeah, that hasn't really been to anyone for a while though. I've been trying to find a GP, um, and it's, it's been. Yeah. It's been a time.Doctor: Uh, urine supplements or anything like that?Patient: Uh, just the like multivitamins and, and um, any other as needed medications other than the rizatriptan? Ondansetron waits as well.Doctor: How often are you getting nausea?Patient: Um, it's, it's sort of like when the migraines are really bad, yeah. Um, and then like. Um, uh, naproxen. And that's that is the only sort of really I've been given, um, that I'd take that more so like when we like. Migraine. I tried to take that before taking.Doctor: Yeah.Patient: Um, and then I, I do have uh diazem, but I usually we have like one table left on the sachet thing from um when I was giving it back in 2022, so.Doctor: That's for jet like panic attacks or.Patient: Um, not, not really anymore, yeah, yeah.Doctor: So what are you using it for, um, yeah, but you're not going into that too often?Patient: No.Doctor: Um.Patient: This uh I feel like I have updated it since then, but this is.Doctor: OK.Patient: Oh. And I feel like there's been more.Doctor: Mhm.Patient: So.Doctor: OK.Patient: Oh.Doctor: My chart.Patient: Oh.Doctor: Mm.Patient: Can you email that?Doctor: Yeah.Patient: I certainly do have a more up to date one at home, but I can email this one now and then I have your email to email it. Yeah.Doctor: So it's just practise at Bluff Road Medical.Patient: It's another campaign um her name is <REDACTED PII>.Doctor: She's a dietitian. Are you on any particular diet?Patient: Um, no.Doctor: He vegan, vegetarian or anything like that? OK. And was there any particular, so why are you seeing a dietitian, I guess?Patient: Mhm. Nothing it's a bad thing. Is there a particular reason I suppose like I think like food. It's more intensive text.Doctor: Um.Patient: And yeah, and sort of like decreased appetite and, and. Yeah.Doctor: What a sensitivities.Patient: Um, and like it, um. Like I, I don't know, like, um.Doctor: And you're like allergic to food, like tummy pain or.---3000,3300Doctor: And you're like allergic to food, like tummy pain or GI upset sometimes do and like uh. OK. What's your menstrual cycle like? Is it painful? Is it heavy? How is your. OK, what's the most, I guess what's the most pressing thing, what's the most bothersome for you? And have you seen a physio or anything like that?Patient: Yeah, he said that sensational and sometimes that is like have eaten food and and then other times it's just hard to know if that's sort of like the fancy MPS sort of just the nerve doing things. But yeah, I also do sort of like between like the constipation and diarrhoea, um, but sometimes that seems to be like the conservation more so seems to be related to like menstrual cycle. See if I can really up just before. Um, not really, but, and the like that made drops, um, and the pain sometimes it's like just my whole body is really painful. Um, and then that's how I will know that, yeah, um, and then sleep is just, you know happening, um. It's, I feel like it's sort of about 7 to 10 days before the period and then like a few days while on your period, like well. Um, and it's kind of like this sort of like tired but wired and like the like the like sleep hygiene just just try to do all the things and it's just no. Um, Yeah. But it's, it's, it feels like it's regularly. My sister, like she's got PMDD and like she has PCOS and stuff like that and like it hurts like it was very heavy and very painful, um, and I don't feel like it's doing as bad as this. It's been sort of more like it was like working on like regularity and things like that, but like sometimes it was like, especially like we like the vis it was like apiat wasn't always really there, but also I would just forget to look like it sometimes. Um, and then yeah, I do. Um, I don't like, yeah, well I like I don't know that like the, the, the ADS side of things, or do you have any, we need to do a kind of an examination for that. I feel like neck and neck is sort of that the like the petite. Um, And then the EDS like cause I feel like it's. And like I just wake up and it's like food. Shoulder like the ribs and it's just and then I'm like doing things and yeah. Well, I mean like previously, but I'm not in sort of the financial standpoint to do so, but if I were to take a diagnosis like the access to and I, um. One thing that we are hoping to do, um, as well as if we can get solid diagnosis for these things is get funding through the NPI at the moment it's like social. Um, the division also I've noticed that I've got like the around my eyes is like sort of bluish um but then like further out in the um, I feel like yellowish like.---3300,3600Doctor: Is that new or is that, the, the blue was like last year when the migraines were like getting really bad again, and my eyes were like really painful like was looking in the mirror and I was like, whoa, what's with the blue thing? And I thought that like, like you like here it's like quiet. Prominent and yeah, like I thought like it was migrating, um, but it's, it's.Patient: Yeah, and then I did look at like my brother's eyes and he also has that side of me. They, yeah, they, and I, I, I don't know, maybe that they were like it could be saying that rheumatoid arthritis and I didn't think that that's um, related to, but maybe.Doctor: OK. When you're on the Revis does that help with fatigue?Patient: Yeah, so I was initially prescribed it for the fatigue attacks that um were happening, from a psychiatrist. Yeah, yeah, and then.Doctor: So, OK, look, the stimulants are often very good for fatigue.Patient: Yeah, like the pain clinic they were like um they were like, oh we'd recommend something that is you already and yeah, and they're like just to increase it and increase it up to 70 and I was like, you can kind of with it, um, but it's balanced against the hot stuff, yeah, um, and then the other thing to look out for is that it's a false energy.Doctor: So be mindful of that. To use the heart rate variability stuff you know watch or anything like that?Patient: Yeah, um, the tacky one. Um, but, um, yeah, it does show you that how you feel.Doctor: Yeah. So it's very common to have like the heart. I don't know what active heart everything then you're on the stimulant, essentially speed.Patient: OK.Doctor: So that's what a stimulant is, essentially, um, so it'll make your heart race. I think we really have to balance all these things in.Patient: Yeah.Doctor: So I guess if you don't have pots or something like that, then it's not such a big deal, but even they will notice their heart rate goes up and and people with pots or intolerance.Patient: Yeah, right, because my husband has, has lots of emphasis about you, but I'm just interested why you're looking in his heart is frequently doing strange things too, so it's a lot more than me.Doctor: Yeah, so one of the, one of the kind of gurus of pots actually likes putting on stimulants. So he does high dose um, dexamphetamine, um, it works really well for some people.Patient: Yeah.Doctor: But for other people that just makes a heart rate go way too high and I hate it.Patient: And I realised that we totally had the EDS conversation. I'm trying to keep on top of my understanding of all of this as well, sorry. I've done like a little bit on my phone, but I've been doing like don't know like the visible. It's like a wearable thing that's not available in Australia.Patient: But you take like your heart rate and the morning and then you can like, check against like other things, but that's sort of the, there's loads of different apps. Yeah, but that's sort of yeah, there's lots of different versions.Doctor: OK.---3600,3900Doctor: One of the things with the propranolol is known can make fatigue worse. Um, altered response. But yeah. Are you an allergy sort of person? OK, so what we probably need to do, so you need a referral for a psychiatrist. It sounds like that's probably something that definitely needs to happen. This is for you to fill out later. So you're not working currently. So these are the things to fill in later, um.Patient: I know this doesn't necessarily mean, yeah, it's like for me it's an altered response. Like, uh, yeah, as a kid, I was even a fan to like when we were going on a long flight to visit my grandparents in <REDACTED PII>. And my brother zoned out and I was like running around the plane, yeah, that's just sort of been a lot of like my medications are just like, but I'm just saying. Um, no. Uh, zebra. But I think you, you name it it's speech that time. I came across your name searching. Uh, another time. But yeah. I can't remember. More like. I am living by myself. Sort of like an auditing role of HK. Like so like nursing, but not guessing.---3900,4200Doctor: OK. How many days are you doing that? Are you OK with that from a fatigue point of view? Yes. Yeah. No. No. No, um. I mean, getting NDIS for chronic fatigue is hard, but you can. As possible. Um, have you been hooked up with an EP before? OK. Might be good. I might refer you to <Redacted>. I think um pretty open to funding the NBA as well, and she is also a gun at getting you onto NDIS. So she knows all the tricks. But she's got horrible wait time. They are incredibly hard, but my strategy is usually to flick you to one of the telehealth ones, they suck. They're not good, but they will usually give you the drugs, the main thing we want. So the problem is if you want an overhaul, that's impossible. Well, it's not impossible, but to the wait times and they're literally not taking anyone. They're just so full and or not interested. Frankly, it's crap. So yeah, I kind of really depends what the game is. So if the game is mostly to get drugs, at least to begin with, telehealth is going to be the way to go. Like I said, they're not great. But they'll usually, I mainly use them to give me permission to script. The one I use is fluid in that they don't like you, so they don't want to see you again. So they just give us like, try this. If that doesn't work, try this. If that doesn't work, try that, so they give us a whole range. OK. OK. And then I fiddle and I'm very happy to um like I said, they're still not good. Yes, you'll get an hour with them and they'll just and then usually they'll be like oh yeah, and then they turf you back and you have to see them every 2 years to get the thing, but at least you can get in within a couple of weeks. So that might not be a bad strategy to start with.Patient: 4 hour shifts. Um. Yeah. I don't know. Everyone keeps saying, oh just hold out like you know you just got to wait a little bit longer and. But even like sort of the ATS and then being able to like the physio. I think I was seeing one at, at <REDACTED PII> back in 2019. I was gonna say, do you, do you have like a magic cauldron that you can conjure with a psychiatrists because that seems to just be unreal. I'm just like the the the like the. The car scripting sort of senses it's. Um. Is that what you're sort of meaning or like just the telehealth like online, it's in person. How do you mean? Um, well, like I, I found um a psychiatrist and then their wait time was really long, but I found them online and so I reached out and yeah, sure thing. And then it turned out that it was like just for the ADHD meds and it was like had to be coded scripting so like they would like write a letter to the GP and then the GP could. I'm not even like I don't even like I don't know if like the lithium or I don't like sort of I've not had like a yeah. That my previous psychiatrist, every time she would just like she would just sign and go it's just really complicated or really complex and like um yeah, and then once, once I got sort of the diagnosis of things who sort of like didn't. Yeah, that sounds too hot. I'm not, I'm not interested in experiencing because they're just like, yeah, we don't, we don't care. I refer to public, and then the public doesn't care.---4200,4500Patient: Half of them, more than half of them were just like, yeah, that sounds too hot. I'm not, I'm not interested in experiencing because they're just like, yeah, we don't, we don't care. I refer to public, and then the public doesn't care. I like put cat team and stuff like oh you have like a private psychiatrist so it like with him in 2 months' time, so you'll find I don but like yeah, look, the whole psychiatry thing makes me mad and to be honest, every time a young female goes to the public, they're just like, yeah, borderline. Yeah, um, the lithium was supposed to augment with an antidepressant, but then she took me off antidepressant, and then, but then when I asked her, I'm like, she put me on medication that I've been on when I first broke my leg when I was 15, and I, I don't remember it, but I apparently I was off my face and I said I don't want to go back on that one, and she was like, no, that, that was then, this is now, and then she put me on it and I even got like my mom to come to the appointment and she's like, no, no, it's fine and then. I don't really remember like then, but like with with but when. Sorry, we um, the most recent time, it was like I would get out of the tower and I had like gotten to like rinse off. So, or like I was like just I don't know, I was like. It didn't, I just felt like I was sort of losing my mind a little bit like I just was like I would lock myself out and like all these like sort of things going on. It wasn't, I don't think it was necessarily like um. Physiological adverse reaction, but it was like, my brain was not quite right. I don't have restless legs. I think so. I think I just like to do it sometimes. Yeah. Um, I have, sorry, I don't know if this is relevant or not. This has happened a few times, but I, I jot it down when it happened, um, where it's like, I'm just, it's like I'm like, I don't know, I can't this is my. It's like a night terror. But um that was like a sort of, hadn't even gone to sleep and then another time that's happened, I was sort of like laying on on. The couch. Um, but it's like a weird, it's like, like the whooshing and then my eyes are like. and that I'm, yeah, I don't know. But that time there was like, yeah, in my head, like he's screaming. I wasn't screaming. No one else was there. It sounds like. How often has that happened? 3 or 4 times but it's it's sort of yeah.Doctor: Well, you're just anxious, just really anxious and you just need to pull this up together, so generally how it goes, it's pretty hard. The one psychiatrist I had was good has also closed his books, so. OK. Do you have restless legs? So look, I think that's probably, and are you allergic to anything? Um, I mean, you haven't experienced anything. Mhm, OK. It's kind of, it's usually as you're falling asleep, that it's kind of like you almost fall asleep, but you don't. And you get the paralysis. So it's kind of that halfway sort of spot. So as you go to where your body gets paralysed sometimes your mind wakes up, but what it doesn't, and it's really. That's the most trippy feeling sort of thing. Yeah, it sounds like a that's a parasomnia kind of thing.---4500,4800Doctor: They suck, um. So that feeling of something in the womb or something like that. How often does that happen?Patient: Because I've also had like um, this people not there, but like waking up and it's like people are coming to it can be like I'm not and it's there, yeah. The first time it happened it was like I know. And they were like in the doorway. It was like a tuna lied figures and they're like coming at me and then I just scream and I run through them, but like there was no other way out. It was not funny at the time. You physically got up and then, yeah, yeah, and then I like sort of um. That's happened 3 times. Um, the first time. What you are now. First time you lost your. And then 2 times this year. So here and see things which aren't there. Yeah, but those were like those times it's like I woke up. It has happened a couple of times. I been awake. But I feel like there's been during times when I have been not sleeping very well. And so like I've been tired.Doctor: Do you ever get kind of other than those homes, do you have, does that ever happen? Do you see or hear things which other people can't see you here?Patient: Um, the same. And then like hearing um, I've just been told like I can hear things. Like, like he like sort of the electricity and heat of the train that's like. But no one else can hear them, but there is a train.Doctor: Yeah good hearing. Do you ever feel like, you know, you're hearing voices other than your own in your hand or like? Kind of thoughts being inserted into your head? That aren't yours.Patient: Um, I sometimes, like not like. Mhm, they were like the um, please have questions they were asking when they were when I was in um, try to do the AD. And stuff, and that was like around the association meetings, um. And it seems like it wouldn't like. Uh, around. Oh and it's that like when that is. um, the symptoms get worse.Doctor: Yeah, yeah. So it's part of what is called a standard, like a mental state exam. So pretty much every time I some sort of mental health and stuff I'm supposed to do one of those. I guess, you know, sometimes they can put you down. One pass or another. So you get disassociative episodes around trauma, like you feel like you're, like out of this body sort of thing.Patient: Yeah, um, and sometimes we use kind of time. And like this like. Well I like find myself in the middle of like cooking. And, but I was, it's like, but I, I wasn't like I. Like I was just on the couch.Doctor: The old meal thing happening.---4800,5100Doctor: Like, I was just on the couch, but now I am in the middle of cooking something that I remember, yeah. Um, I feel like you lose track of what's happening when it's happening sometimes and sometimes it's like I know I'm focused, but then sometimes I think it's more like it's actually just that, but then other times it feels like it's just not quite right, out of body. And was a psychiatrist they were playing with any of those kind of like disassociative sort of things or put it trauma related? And no other seizure-like activity do they ever work you up for epilepsy or anything like that? So in terms of the trauma stuff, can we talk about that a bit more? I'm happy to leave the room and then doesn't. For later for now. Have you read The Body Keeps the Score, Bessel van der Kolk? But it was a 3, so kind of I guess part of the reason of asking was sometimes knowing around what the trauma was sometimes can look at different ways we can try and approach treating it, I guess. And he talks very nicely about different strategies and how different ones seem to help different people when they were related or event related or it's cool, that sort of thing. So that was kind of where I was going, um. OK. And at this for a while. Um, so there's probably a few blood tests we should do. I'm gonna do a, are you OK with blood tests? Um, and I always tend to get an abdominal X-ray, um. Safe if you actually fatally loaded, so it's really common to have basically mats of poop backed up and that can mess up with a whole bunch of different things including pots and all that sort of stuff, um. We can quickly do the EDS criteria and we'll see how you go with that.Patient: Like, I can't find things and then there's like a not like a. I feel like you lose track of what's happening when it's happening sometimes and sometimes it's like I, I know I'm yeah, but it doesn't feel like it just, yeah, and then sometimes I can. And I focused, but then sometimes. I think it's more like the, it's actually just that, but then other times it feels like it's just just the, it's just not quite right. Yeah, yeah. And then does the outer body happen with the flocks of lost time? Usually together. Yeah. Yeah, no, not, not really, um. Yeah. And that even like the psychologist time, um we sort of like, you know, we just know that that's part like with the trauma so you see. Get through the and then we'll all be fine. I'm happy to leave the room and then doesn't. For later for now. Um, I think it's been recommended to 100 times as well. It's a very good we both need to read it.---5100,5400Doctor: We can quickly do the EDS criteria and we'll see how you go with that. Are these my copies? I think some of them are original, but most of them are printed out. If you can, yes, and then we can have a think about potential medications.Patient: Can I just email those ones back to you? I just emailed those forms to the same email address.Doctor: Did I give it to you?Patient: I think I have it. Thank you.Doctor: OK. So I'll take your shoes off. I might need to turn the lights back on.Patient: Do you want me to move out of the way?Doctor: OK, so standing up for me and showing what you can do. Can you get your hands flat on the ground without bending your knees? Easy. Show me your elbows. Can you do the thumb? And can you do the pinky thing? Just pull your pinky back.Doctor: So your links are hyper. Just sitting on the bed with your legs out this way.Patient: Yes.Doctor: Keep calm. Easy for that. OK, standing up for me. This stretch you up.Doctor: Have you had any hernias? Any weird scars?Patient: I don't.Doctor: Any particular weight gain or loss?Patient: Um, yeah, it was weight gain, but I don't even know.Doctor: Without any particular explanation. When was your sleep study?Patient: 2023, 2022, OK, 2020.Doctor: So your aortic group was fine. You haven't got any problems with your teeth?Patient: Other than the wisdom teeth coming out, it's like these pointy ones, they're kind of like.---5400,5700Patient: Not like I mean this is, but like they're like. Yeah, I you just mad at you for any reason? Um. Not, not, not particularly, but whenever I floss, even when I do it, it's always like and then it like really swells and it's really painful.Doctor: nothing. Oh. just opening it. And why did you need your wisdom teeth out? Um, pain. And it was like all come through and it was like 2 or 3 of them like we just take them all back. OK, were they causing problems with the other teeth?Patient: Yeah, with a little finger. And the other? What OK. Let's measure your height. Yeah, OK. Um yeah 66. OK. And then kind of get you set up this. OK. And ss switch up to the wall, because then you get hold of my thing. long as possible. Thanks. It. 66162. OK. Anyone else in your family, hypermobile?Patient: Um, Like immediate family or extended?Doctor: Uh, immediate.Patient: Um, I mean, like my brother can lift his leg up over his head, but not really like diagnosed. And have you ever dislocated anything? Um. I, I don't. I think this maybe like the sort of potentially subblocks.Doctor: Shoulders or limbs orPatient: I did something to my knee recently, um, and that was it. Yeah. It was just was not quite right, not in place and then um very painful driving kneecap. Yeah, and, and then it did seem to sort of come back in and for them to do an MRI and it was just there, but after it felt. Like it was in place and it was just.Doctor: OK. Uh, just once or?Patient: Um, the knee, um. I think it's happened like in the time like when I was.Doctor: OK. And was that in the setting of trauma or,Patient: um, this was I, I just want to sit down on the couch, but I tucked my legs.Doctor: OK, so it wasn't a tackle.Patient: or something, no, no, no, it was just I mean Milo's pretty sure.Doctor: OK. And let's just have a look at your hand. So I'm just gonna poke your head in my church. OK. Is that OK? Does that suck?Patient: Well, not too bad. That does.Doctor: What does that do for you? Just pain. Does this feel kind of hypersensitive?Patient: Not at the moment, but there are other times where that.Doctor: Yeah, OK. So does that coincide with your head? Um,Patient: Sometimes and sometimes. irrelevant to. OK.Doctor: This one. That's not too bad.Patient: That one's like it's it. I feel like we kept doing it, it would be, but not as bad.Doctor: as I wanted, yeah. Just dropping your head forward for me.Patient: that's Yeah, yeah. It's like the clearest.Doctor: with Um.Patient: I was told by psychiatrist that did the TMS like.---5700,6000Doctor: I was told by psychiatrist that did the TMS like mapping that I had a weird head like the. There's like a dip in the back there. I don't know what that means a phrenologist. I don't know. I don't know what to make of it. OK. Yeah, um, OK. And you have no other types of. And no other problems like with your eyes. Other than the floaters, but they're happy there's no like cartoonis or anything like that. Uh of my. Uh. And the opal they do um. they do a sickness of cornea tests? Pleasure, I didn't remember anything about the. It's I'm not sure. What you think it might be worth? Genetic testing because there's a thing called brittle cornea syndro.Patient: Types. Um, I had, uh, growing pain in my knees, but no, you don't know if you had any problems with your hips or anything like that. No, I did, um. I did uh infection. Clothing and that I don't know. Yeah. But it we also didn't really go to the doctor a lot. Thank you. Might have been there was something about the acute angle. That. Because there was something about there was like um. Yeah, I don't know, that was like. Narrow angles. Yeah, that's and they thought that he had like the Clara, the black thing. I love your Totoro and all the and the little black bulls like they called cities or yeah. That's not what it's meant to be about, no, it's just a little um ferrofluid, so it's got a microphone, so it dances to the music, but if you grab the little magnet, you can drag them around a bit. Really.---6000,6300Doctor: Genetic testing because there's a thing called brittle cornea syndrome, which is one of the EDSs and bluish sclera is one of them, not quite. So yeah, the only thing is the genetic test, the problem is. So these are the major and minor criteria. So you've got the blue sclera. I don't think you've got that. Don't have fur or detached menu. And I think your hearing is probably fine. But you've got some hypermobility, you don't have these, you do have that a little bit just because your hands are pretty much my show. Did you have any hip problems as a kid? Do you remember? Any hip problems now? Can you, uh, step back a bit so you can't run your face backwards so you don't run your face into the chair and just rolling down. Thank you.Patient: And I'm like whatever like writing or like. Yeah, sometimes they feel quite inflamed. Um, but not really. Sometimes it's like popping sound, but it's not like it's popping out of place. Uh, I think I said that it wasn't. Well. I always feel like on like markets and like it was just like it just went. Yeah. No.Doctor: He's pretty bad. So, yeah, look, I think let's get a couple of these. This will tell us a bit more if you've got.---6300,6600Doctor: So many scoliosis and hip problems. If you've got those, I think we probably should refer for genetic testing. There's almost no chance we'll get accepted by the public. The genetic test itself is expensive and ronal is expensive. So get some bunch of X-rays. If you go to vision, they're all bulk bill. I don't know where the EOS machine is. I might need a bit of a worries. So we'll do that. I'll flick through some blood tests. I'll have a read through of your stuff. If you can send through all the medications that you have tried, I've got your list that you are currently taking, but I want a list of tried but failed in all the side effects including supplements. Because I don't know what to try and not try. I mean, so as it stands, we'll probably need to do a couple of blood tests to essentially just say you don't have like a rheumatic conditions, you would make hypermobile EDS, you might have one of the monogenetics. But we can't know that until we do the thing. From a psychiatry standpoint, how do you want to play that? I can do that, so I'm happy to take that on and then it's in the clinic and then I guess the thing about that would be to go essentially with. Well, the thing is, you still don't have to go with anyone here. You can come in just for the ADHD meds and then like if you have a cold or whatever, then you go somewhere else, but probably here is cool, is that everything's in one place. I said there's a couple of psychiatrists we can try if you want a more comprehensive sort of. I mean fluence says they will do it. I don't know we could try, we can try and see iflu will kind of give us a whole whole thing. But then they probably won't do it in a single one, or in multiples. OK. Should we try that? Yeah, that's probably the quickest. The other one's God knows. Thank you a referral for X-ray as well. There's 3 X-rays. You know, you've got some cranial cervical instability on the neck. You need to physio for that. I'm. Is there such a thing as there's like yeah you can get a one of those chronic disease care plans. 5 sessions of 60 bucks back or something like that. Good, the physio. You can do. Well, the thing is you need two allied health. So if you do an EP and a physio.Patient: OK, no worries. Sorry. And through the um. Why space step for that GP um because if it's do that um. Go down. Yeah, um. Yeah, but he he would prescribe, I feel like it's, yeah, I don't know. I'll send them through electronically to do um. Yeah.---6600,6900Doctor: 55 calendar year total really hard. Appointments that you can do it for physio, you can do it for EP, you can do it for dietitian, you can do it for whatever. All you have to do is allocate 5 of them to physio; you just have to have a dietitian say yes, they'll be a part of it. It's extremely complicated. So we can do that. There's a particular neck physio, I tend to, there's a neck and headache physio that I work with, but they're up north or in the city. Uh, Fiona make it. Don't get Cairo. I'm never let anyone crack in there. So, we gonna take a second to spinal. I'll refer you to Jackie as well, get on her waiting list. Do you need a GP management plan? That thing which gets you some funding. Um, so I'll get one of the nurses to talk to you and do it. I want to share. Yeah, it's extremely boring. They can probably do it by telly I think. OK, and then there's probably a few, you know, I wanna do a NASA lean. I mean, there's a whole bunch of other shit we can talk about, but we've already gone for like 2 hours so to call it on that. There's a bunch of myths that I'm thinking of that we can try. One thing which might help you would be to see what's got a great up central nerve block, so basically put a needle in the back here, it can give you really good headache relief. Yeah, and giving you a bunch of other things to fill out and they're looking at, you know, mast cell activation syndrome, which sometimes commonly coexists with pots and with hyperability and can explain kind of widespread pain, and some of the gut stuff. I mean, you've already had sleep study, so I don't know how far I'll go chasing form of sleep diagnosis. OK. But I'm getting really booked out, so you might as well just book yourself in and like somewhere between 4 to 6 weeks. Can we do that on the way out, just because, yeah, I'm getting pretty booked out. One of, did you read that big ass letter that I sent you? Which one did you get? Yeah. OK. So usually we get you to sign one of these before. You didn't have to print it out and sign it, did you?Patient: <Redacted> did it and she's the MDI OK, yeah, so yeah, I think unless they've changed the goddamn rules again, which they always do and I have recently just to keep us on our, but that's OK. Yeah, that's right seafood. The other one I know is way out. Who's that person in the city? Have these. Yeah, no, no, no, yeah, the, and the car is that they didn't do any like manual. Yeah, no, no, no, yeah, the, and the car is that. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Um, booking in again, do I, or just do all the things and then wait to do all the things, do all the tests, and then again, yes, I did, but I wouldn't be able to tell you what it was on time. I did read it though. I got the whole thing and I scrolled to be. That was the complex I think is what they said. Would they have it takes time.---6900,7200Doctor: Um, one of the things that I can do in a probably would be helpful would be to put together basically everything you've got into one big thing. So you've got one master kind of record of everything. That's gonna take hours, so there will be a charge they want to do it. I cap it at essentially an hour's worth, so you're gonna be take me 4 hours I charge for an hour, but it's $444. So on top of the consult which is 500. Is that OK? We can do it later. Is that OK to break out, is that OK? Um, we'll have to talk downstairs. Um, we can definitely spread it out, however, however you like. Thank you. I appreciate that. OK, so I'll just get you, so be probably the thing to be aware of. A lot. So basically it's 500 for today and then I'm gonna write up a giant letter for you, which will summarise everything. Yeah, it would be 9:44, but we can spread that and have many as you like, so. So are you happy for stuff to come by email? It's not secure. We're all being watched, um, we're using an AI the jig, um, so so um so if you're happy, I'll get you to give me a squiggle there. That summary will be really useful for the NDIS as well. Good. Uh, so yeah, I'll send you the blood thing. I'll do organise the referral for Flu, they should be able to get to you within. Usually within a month, we can get it and then we can hopefully get you on the medications, um, and yeah, once I've got the other list, then I've got a whole bunch of other things. We can try for pots and everything else, um, yeah, next time, yeah, I'll probably do the injection. Um, so that's yeah, it takes about 15 minutes, um. It's like 50 bucks for the meds um. Yeah, I works really well, um. And yeah, and then, yeah, we've got a whole bunch of other stuff to think about. Good start. Thank you so much. Any, anything else you wanna? Well, I think so. Have a read of the letter, you'll be stupidly long, um. What often suggests for people to just print it out and he can write notes, so any questions, OK. OK. No worries. And so this one, can't throw away cause it's, yeah, yeah, if that's, that's fine. OK, it's just a reminder to me. OK. Thank you. No worries. OK. So yeah, if you book for 4 to 6 weeks then we should get all the tests and whatnot and we can. If something super exciting pops up on that, yeah.Patient: Um, will you charge for it? Today or? to the 21st. Actually, everything's clear.---7200,7500Patient: I might be you for telehealth. So that's it like wildly constipated, like it actually stop that yeah you got a different products, Mondays, Wednesday so I OK OK thanks."

But um, um, but, but having listened to your stories, uh, I think, um, just to recap, the, for the last 3 days, you've been having stool, diarrhoea, a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left-hand side, and vomiting and feeling generally quite weak and lethargic, you mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well 3 days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. I feel that you may have something called gastroenteritis, which is essentially just the tummy bug or infection of your tummy, mainly caused by viruses it can be a possibility of bacteria, uh, causing your symptoms. At this stage, uh, what, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management, so I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just um making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids, um, uh, there are things like dire light you can get from the pharmacy, which, uh, it's um it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. Um, and if you are having vomiting and diarrhoea, I would say recommend that the first, you know, first couple of days. If you feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, uh, 2 tablets up to 4 times a day for the first few days can also help. I'll certainly advise you to take some time off work actually. I know you're quite keen to work, um, I would say next 3 days, clears from your system, take some time off and rest, um, you know, if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in, in 3 to 4 days, I'd like to come back and see me again. How's that sound? Do you have any questions for me? OK. Is it, is the treatment plan clear? Great. Well, I wish you all the best."

Um, do you smoke at all? Yeah. So, normally at this stage, I'd like to examine you if that's OK. But, having listened to your stories, I think, just to recap, for the last 3 days, you've been having stool diarrhoea, a bit of tummy pain, mainly on the left-hand side, and vomiting and feeling generally quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway 3 days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis, which is essentially just the tummy bug or infection of your tummy, caused by viruses, but there can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms. At this stage, what we'd recommend is just conservative management, so I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just to make sure you're well hydrated, drink fluids, there are things like dioralyte you can get from the pharmacy, which helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. If you are having vomiting and diarrhoea, I would say recommend that the first couple of days. If you're feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, 2 tablets up to 4 times a day for the first few days can also help. I'll certainly advise you to take some time off work actually. I know you're quite keen to work, I would say next 2 to 3 days until the travel clears from your system, take some time off and rest. If your symptoms haven't got better in 3 to 4 days, I'd like you to come back and see me again. OK, sure, because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms, and we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that etc. etc. How's that sound? Do you have any questions for me? OK. Is the treatment plan clear? Well, I wish you all the best."

OK, so I got a letter from your GP Doctor <REDACTED PII> oh, and actually just before we go, how would you like your pronouns you say. OK. And, and what do you consider your gender identity. And uh assigned.Patient: Yeah, do we put that? Um, so yeah, actually, uh, He took out like chronic health related things more broadly. um I already been fully diagnosed with um hypermobile family and. Um And um I know it's ADHD, um. And yeah, very much been wondering if, um, any ECFS is in the picture, um, potentially impact, um, Yeah, they're kind of the main sort of things that are on my mind, um, yeah, then sort of like a pinch like clustery of all of those things, sort of, um, and disentangle, I guess like how best to navigate them, like something I've been particularly thinking about is like. Um, like whenever I do, for example, like exercise or have like fatigue in days in general whether it's like mentally, emotionally, physically, um, I know that very much like that crash sort of thing, um. So they were a bit delayed, um, but I know that for example we've like EDS, it's important for example like you do try to like some maintenance of like muscle strengthening and said sort of trying to figure out how best to so what's going on, how best to balance or navigate things, um, and just have some more clarity around the stuff.Doctor: Sure, OK. So let's just go through a couple of things. So who else is in your care team?Patient: Um, so yeah, Erica <REDACTED PII>, who is my GP, um, and also saw I no longer see him but saw that Doctor <REDACTED PII>. I was diagnosis.---300,600Doctor: So who was the name <REDACTED> and then <REDACTED> um a cardiologist for um I go to a psychiatrist, um, Doctor <REDACTED>. I also see a GP, um, primarily the gender family care, um, which is Doctor <REDACTED> Yeah, that's her gender. Um, what should he help you with?Patient: Um, and Doctor <REDACTED> or the Pops. I have a therapist, not a psychologist, but um, yeah, therapist, um, the name is Ne <REDACTED>. Oh, that one, yeah, and then it is, so <REDACTED>. Primarily, if I start seeing them around just like navigating your like capacity and work and you're in and just like burn out and things, um, and so it's yeah very much sort of ongoing like yes, support regarding that and. I think in general like I consider my my mental health to be like pretty good amidst all of the things um sort of like it's like burn out capacity, health, etc. um. So sertraline 25 milligrammes a day. Um, and fitting, um, 7.5 milligrammes 3 times a day. Um, Clonidine, um, at night. half a tablet, I can't remember what I 5 mcg, um, propranolol. Forms have like, um, 3 times a day. Um, Mediterranean. One tablet, again, can't remember the dosage. Yeah, yeah, that's right, yeah, um, at morning and midday, um. Um Finasteride. quarter of a tablet, which I think is like 1.25, um. Every, that, that's once a day and that's just, um, alongside Teogel, um, which is 2 pumps a day. Um Metoclopramide is a PRN for migraine, um, so get pretty frequent migraine, um. I think that's that's it. Um, so have a classic thing that a lot of, I think, and then, yeah, things like, like lots of various things. So, um, I like pollen related things, dust, um, various adhesive related things like um bandages, I think, and progressively over time it just seemed to become like more reactive to. share those things but no specific drug allergies that I know of other than the penicillin. Like with how Uh, no, it's just oxycodone, yeah, yeah, that made the two times that I've taken it, I've taken like very small dose and it, I absolutely. comments so much. That like welts and rash, um, but I was, yeah, very, very young.Doctor: No worries. OK. Uh, what medications are you on? Anything else comes to mind? And I've got do Um, allergies? OK, yep, we don't want to have that security vomiting, um. And then, yeah, the penicillin, do you remember what happened to that? Was that like welts and rash, um, but I was, yeah, very, very young.Patient: And any medications you've tried before, didn't work.---600,900Doctor: And any medications you've tried before, didn't work. Do you find that the metoclopramide works? How often do you get the migraines? Sorry, so I'm not very familiar with kind of the genderfirming stuff. Do you still have a period? And does that mess up everything else? Are you on any particular diet? How are your guts if you don't have gluten? Do you get abdominal pain like immediately after eating? Does it change with position?Patient: Maxalt to migraines didn't seem to help much. I think I've also tried Adansetron, and that didn't seem helpful migrating. I find that if I manage to catch the migraine when it's first starting, it seems to help a bit with microullated nausea, but not the migraine. I can't remember any of this. Oh, I used to be on Vyvanse for ADD and that did not work for me. It didn't seem to be tolerated by me like it didn't really do anything executive function wise, but I would get a lot of like the, um, just regulations of nervous system, um, like decreased heart rate because my act. Pretty frequently, like, um, I'd say more days than not. Yeah, they're not ideal, and they tend to very much cluster with like plays and other things. Um, yes, I do, and it's, um, I get it approximately every 4 to 6 weeks, it's a little bit inconsistent, but that has always been the way with it. So gluten-free, um, and pretty sure I'm Celiac. I haven't done the testing on it, um, nothing else in particular. I don't eat heaps of meat, um, just cause it's, it's like I don't enjoy it, but um, yeah, nothing else apart from that. So in, uh, I get like I guess. I get nausea most days, um, can be, yeah, I get quite a bit of like cramping and bloating and things, um, apparently like since I was a child, I've had like since I was a baby, I've had issues with like digestive things, um. Like when I'm had quite constipation, um, and then that has been intermittent throughout my life. It doesn't seem to be so that probably these days as um, diarrhea is, but that doesn't come too frequently. Yeah, I think things are definitely settled relative to like in terms of digestive things, um. As I like, yeah, so having, for example, like that's definitely helped a lot. Um, uh, stomach pain, bloating, cramping, um. Yeah, I get some reflux sometimes as well. Um, sleep can be a little bit inconsistent, um. I generally find that like no matter how much sleep I get, I don't feel rested, um, I tend to be sort of at least like 9 or 10 hours a night. I will have insomnia, um, probably like at least once a week.---900,1200Patient: No, like probably like at least once a week, but then it will increase depending on the pain levels and things like that, um, and so probably at least a couple of times a month, it'll be nice, right? I mean, like, for example, like a couple of hours, um. I'll be able to sleep for like, and there'll be a bit of a like if I have a stretch of insomnia and things that will eventually be a night where I was like, but kind of anywhere between like 12 to 14 hours and then like that updates that kind of breakdown thing, um. They tend to sleep throughout. I unless, um, except there are some nights where there's a very kind of broken sleep where it's like waking up. hard thing, um, I think that I like sometimes it just say that they're like not just because, um. It can be hard to fall asleep at night sometimes, so with, um, I often do feel like I need to, need to wait and things, um, even. I don't particularly like there will be sometimes that sense of urgency, um. Um, yeah, and in terms of like sleep onset, um. Yeah, I try to have a very kind of like consistent routine of like settling down, holding that endings, um. So kind of enough time to kind of like regulate and and fall asleep and things, yeah. OK. Yeah, I, without the, before I went on the clonidine because my sleep was particularly bad, you know. Um, I sometimes have had the whole tablet, um, and that has helped as well, um, but there are also some nights where that doesn't do any of that, yeah. OK. your the I get the schooling and things, um, OK. Like before I went on the medications I thought rate would go up to about 160 or 180, um. And yeah, things like that with it, um. That's heartrate, shortness of breath, um, temperature dysregulation, I will get a lot of pulling if they, they, um, feet, hands, um, Go get quite dizzy when I stand up, um, I also get a lot of nausea, um, pretty consistently, um, and uprightly, I'll also get quite warm and quite a lot of chis yeah um. Yeah. Oh, it's something to think about before I forget. So for a long time it was thought that was having, so for a long time you've been getting seizure-like activity, um, probably since <REDACTED PII>. I need to go definitely. I also had it when I was younger, um, but yeah, more pieces since <REDACTED PII>, um. And I've been keeping on it pretty closely recently to try and do like other things and is anytime, like anytime that the stage your life activity or stages occur, it is when I've gone from like sitting or laying down to standing, um. I treated by that change as opposed to. So, um, they will always start in this hand and it will be a sort of like kind of opening and closing an objection of the motion, um, occasionally they generalise me in trouble at my mom, um, and to make that, um, they always starts in the one place, um. Um, I hear things, say things, etc. when they're happening I can't talk or anything and I often get a um kind of He, uh, kind of like feet to head and like nausea and So things were moved in and out a bit vision wise, um. And yeah, generally just have to wait for them to pass. Um, because it can vary a bit. Sometimes they can be quite.Doctor: Have you tried going up the quantitine? And do you know what type of pots you have. Oh, it's a hyperrenergic or is it? Cooling so it's more that you. OK. And what is the sensation you tend to get most, is it more the I'm not going to faint or is it more fast heart rate, OK. OK, um, sometimes find that the propranolol. So it's always a bit tricky with propranol cause it ditches your blood pressure as well. Um, so it's, and can be a Marcel activator. It's a little bit of a double-edged sword sort of thing, um.---1200,1500Patient: Uh, like brief, like maybe like 10 seconds of time say going on. I'm not quite sure how the longest, but I'd say at least like 30 seconds or a cool um. Apparently I go very red when they happen as well. Salt compression, um, the Mediterranean has been really helpful for dizziness, um. Like I ran out of it recently for a few days and I was quite surprised to remember how it had been before the Metare with things, um. I try to remember to do kind of like this or like um to get up slowly and things are able to um sort of like tense and flexes or get some circulation going and um. I don't have today but I have the compression socks. Um, I've been looking into compression gloves as well, um, cause sometimes, yeah, we. I think it's pots. I'm not sure I think this will get like quite swollen and things, um. Yeah, I've got the compression socks, um, they're all currently in the wash, um. But you have very concerned other things that may helpful um. OK, yeah. Yes, yeah, sort of actually pretty much the main thing that I wear, um, if it's not shorts is, I will tend to wear like. And yeah, I'll turn to my like high waisted like leggings or like bike shorts and jeans and things, um, yeah, I think I usually do that just cause it's preferable for me sensory-wise, but, um, I mean, that's probably a little bit more pervasive. I guess one of the things is, um, so, doing things you really enjoy. If you don't enjoy that anymore, like if your special interest no longer gives you joy, but that's probably more burnout, whereas with chronic fatigue, you still enjoy stuff. But you know, kind of flat in there. So where do you think you sit very much resonates with the chronic fatigue, like, um, still enjoying stuff so wanting to do stuff but just not having the capacity.Doctor: Oh, OK. How much do we, do we a lot? Um, yeah, yeah. I, what sort of stuff are you doing for your pots like conservatively using compression, are you using plenty of salt? What's a compression do you use? So socks are probably the least useful because there's just not much blood in your feet that makes sense. So best bang for a buck is knees to boobs. Um, yeah, so, uh, often actually the shapewear, you can get like men's shapewear, um, it's often the best or very high waisted. Yeah, yeah, so you can get these compression ones. I'll, I'll pop a couple down in a letter for you, um, because yeah, actually the best bang for your buck is, yeah, here, that's where you've got the most. Blunt to scre, your feet and they're not, yeah. Um, sure, so I guess. So untangling chronic fatigue from ME CFS to sleep disorders. To parts, to all that is really freaking hard. Is there gonna be one or the other? I don't know, uh, would be the short of it. To be honest, it probably doesn't matter because you kind of treat it the same, more or less like like the whole thing with ABCFS is kind of like supporting you as best as you can and optimising all the things, so you know, autistic burnout is not gonna be healthy or sleep is not going to be healthy, uncontrolled pots is not gonna be helping. Is it gonna fix it? Maybe not. Um, so the key thing which makes MECFS like probably the most different is that crash, but you do see that on the autistic burn out as well. I mean, that's probably more. Leaning towards that, the definition of chronic fatigue is pervasive fatigue, not better explained by anything else, uh, newer ones suggest that you need some level of autonomic dysfunction or sleep dysfunction of which um. Have you had a sleep study?---1500,1800Doctor: A couple of things I can think of. So I think in terms of things which will really help is. I think you definitely need an exercise physiologist. Because there are the guns that like, how do you manage your energy, how do you, all the strategies around your day, um, yeah, sometimes people use this, so, um, like a or something to look at HIV monitoring, um, particularly for autistics, also for athletes, people who are bad at knowing what their body feels like or I just stupid type A and driven and just like, no, I'll push through and then they go so. This doesn't guarantee you won't, but it gives you is like you slept like ass. Do not push it today. You can still choose to ignore it, but then then you have to wear it. The biggest disadvantage I found with those sort of things is, um, you have to be very consistent about HIV monitoring, which, um, and the best data is actually done overnight, so that's why I like the, um, because you just wear it all the time. You never have to take it off to chart, you can just charge it on your wrist. I don't get any kickbacks from it, um, but that was always my problem with like the smart watches. So you have to take it off your charge, and I do that at night. So it's like you know other people who I don't get them, they're like, oh, I charge you when I, you know. Yeah, the time is often a bed, on in the morning, but you lose that kind of really useful sleep data, so I'm a big fan of these. They're about 300 bucks a year. Um, I can give you a code. You get one free. You get a free month trial and I think if it's referred from me, you get an extra month, so they can be helpful. Um, see, I think definitely need exercise physiologist, um, I think physio is really helpful. So, how much do you understand that hype mobility kind of management?Patient: I think I've got the like good for you like because I work as a clinical psych, um, and work with a lot of folks, um, like all of the folks I work with the fact that many of them have chronic stuff going on, so I've done a lot of like self-education and learning, um, for myself and not to support them, um. And yeah, so with, um, centre that, for example, yeah, the, like keeping muscles strong is very protective, um, I used to do lots of bouldering and things to about 4 times a week. Um, yeah, I think that's, yeah, like when it comes to capacity like, 2 years ago, I would be holding 4 times a week and doing like strength training alongside that in those sessions. I would ride my bike about 100 to 200 km a week and um. Then at the start of last year, I well known for a teeny tiny bit while I was bouldering just on a super bad luck kind of thing, and I ended up having to get tour slash reconstructions last year. And um, yeah, I've noticed that kind of. Yeah, but I haven't been able to get back to it. Any of the level of activity that I've been doing, I think it's sort of coincided with like that ankle injury came after, I think quite a lot of fatigue and burnout, um, and when I just need my ready from it, um. And then, yeah, that was sort of just no need to, yeah, it's just like it's just been, yeah, very consistent and like, like quite a solid drop in capacity in the past couple of years and progressive drops as well in it, um, but yeah, I digress, that was something where things are definitely like I'm just my timeline was like the thing that led to me being identify self diagnosed as autistic ADHD, you know, just like. When was that? That would have been, um, July 2022 is when it was, so from kind of like April to July 2022, things are getting progressively, normal, exhausting, um. And then, yeah, I got um diagnos in Aug.---1800,2100Doctor: Do you think that was a burnout?Patient: And then, yeah, I got diagnosed in August 2022, um, there was progressive deterioration in capacity. I think that was, um, I also to the best of my knowledge, I've never had COVID, but I do wonder whether it might have slipped through like the cracks at some stage like asymptomatic, unidentified. Yeah, I think I've noticed my capacity is reducing, um, but then you have the out that happened in 2022 and then I had a couple of months like I think I had like 10 days off from work where I crashed real hard capacity wise and then had to go back to work. And then I took all of January off in 2023 basically was housebound with um, grade fatigue, etc. And then, yes, from that 2nd ankle reconstruction as well, I found that I just not been able to return to like, like this, it was, yeah, another dropping capacity um that really seems to help. It's just like I've been working really hard to reduce the amount of like things I don't know I'm expecting like I should do it from home like I things. A couple of months ago, like, um, I went to Darwin for a little bit which was definitely lovely, my partner and my family live up there and then on the plane back they didn't sleep on it was like a my life, um, just like a friend really dated them as picked up the next day and no one was able to do it, so I offered to. I knew I didn't really have the capacity for that, um. That friend has quite severe and, um, and I was like, I take the medicine, and I've noticed that like even from that, it just feels more on that feels like a specific instance where they push herself out here too far crashed and had been able to kind of like. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, no.Doctor: OK. Yeah, um, so yeah, not an uncommon thing to hear, like, things are going great, all your coping strategies are awesome and then you get a hit or successive hits, and there's probably a mental side and a physical side as well. I saw. That you return to your pre-crash capacity but without your masking or over sort of thing. So it often is a stock thing and you might not have ever known what your true capacity was because you've just been kind of redlining it for so long.Doctor: So you work as a psych and what's your living situation?Patient: I was, um, I've been living just on my own in a little single-person townhouse, um, which I'm very fortunate to. And, but my partner is really good, which is a um, yeah, so then I'm gonna uh moving in progressively throughout this month. Cool, OK, able to manage everything. Kind of relatively speaking, like, um, so the thing is like, uh, yeah, doing so like sometimes so that they would like things would be like kind of. You know, I'll be able to keep on top of the stuff that absolutely has to happen like I got a little dog and her name is <REDACTED PII> and she's, um, and so like, when it comes like the days where like, you know, very limited capacity be like kind of woke me up like. That's OK, making sure she's fed, got all that feed myself. kind of thing, um and then like that will be put on hold and yeah.---2100,2400Doctor: Um, sure, so yeah, so I think EPT can be good to get a physio to help guide more the rehabbing stuff. I'm gonna just quickly check your neck. Do you have any jaw problems? It feels like you have like, just open place him. Yeah, you get like, and you clincher? So I'm just gonna drop your head forward a little bit here. Does that feel to product? So um a great upset neuralgia, that's actually the cause of the migraine and a really nice easy fix for it and I'll check for cervical instability. Do you know what your blood pressure and heart rate does? I should probably really like to know that. So I actually lie down. Oh, actually, yes, because I wanna see how purple you get. Um, yeah, so possibly other things that I will do is we'll do an abdo X-ray. Um, because just to lie down and just chill out for a bit. Um, constipation is really common, so gas or utility. And whether it's slow transit will be common in this population, um, and, 11 of the series is until you get that sorted, you can't really anything else, um, because it's a driver of both your hyper energyer state because basically you can't just squeezing against this concrete and sympathetic drive, pisses off Marcels. Um, so yeah, until we get that sort it's hard to sort out other stuff, it's not that we can't start. Uh, yeah, until you get that sorted doesn't, so yeah, so that's probably one thing we'll do. I do always recommend a dietician as well. Um, like a probably up to you seem to work in this space, um, like a neuroaffirming psychologist who's comfortable in the space of hypermobility in visual illness, so I in a particular group. Um, that can actually whether I think that could be really helpful for someone who works in the space.Patient: Um, not completely, um, been stop but it will, I can feel it like k yeah. I am sometimes, yeah. OK. I feel definitely a bit more here than I do here, but I know I've got, I've got some nerve damage. To the shower um. OK someone who you want time because I worked on it. Pushed it too far and it's sort of, I think it damages the brachial plexus. Really not you. And I just find that. Yeah, I think, I think that's been something that's been like, uh is finding, yeah, like. Someone that kind of is and then like across all of those things, um, like there's one that I know that's excellent. I'm like, she's a great friend of mine, um, yeah.---2400,2700Doctor: And then like across all of those things, um, like there's one that I know that's excellent. I'm like, she's a great friend of mine, um, has the space is so small end up knowing each other that a gastroenterologist and some of the members of our group have gone to her to get the scope, so it's just like you leave for coffee and it's like you see my butt inside of me that's awkward but lucky she's uh autistic as fuck, so it doesn't matter. It's just like. So that worked out quite well. So they're probably things, um, I'd probably suggest. Trying to get your damn migraines under control because that's not going to help. Um, so the water all suggest you do. Is amitriptyline, low dose amitriptyline. Um, or doxepin. She's one another, they're both in that kind of tricycle sort of last, at the very low doses they're not so much antidepressant. They make, they make you a bit sleepy. They're pretty good for chronic pain, um, and also not add as a. And migraines. Sort of thing. Um, we've also just been recently given authority. people on the um CGRPs, um, so we can also try that. But probably try to add to first just because. And his. Um, and be and do really nice things for us. other stuff like um we try on a different, important, so you Habit. But something else might be able to stop it from the expensive. So, ideally, not having them that often. But also sometimes getting all the Marsel stuff treated, reduces your, Um Frequency of migraine. And sometimes get the posy stuff sorted as well but it's always tricky. Um, there's all these things like this, you know, there's the triad, the, the, the nonna show. In some way just keep adding to it to it it's like the neurodivergence package deal it's like these additional like bonus chronic health things but apparently yeah. It's. Bas lots of measures. I'll make you stand up and give your hands. Oh and we overnight, um, occasionally, but not usually. Cool. So I'll get this uh up for me. time and wandering over. And I did see you've seen a neurologist.Patient: Yes. Uh, just meaning. I just a bit further out, uh, I'm not that far out sympathetic and just lock up your keys and rest your butt against the wall. And try not to use your quads to hold you up. And let me know if you get hit today. Uh, yeah, so what did the neurologist do? Um, so that was um that was just for like epilepsy and yeah, just because yeah. Uh, yeah, that's an answer. There's been a few times this year, for example, like, um,---2700,3000Doctor: OK. So that was the end result of that. And they did an EEG as well. Do you find it hard to read? Do you have any other like pelvic floor dysfunction, so, um, do you have a leak? And what about, um, do you have a do like penetrate? Yes. I know. Are they very heavy? Sometimes if it fixes the menstrual stuff and all the other layers get better so yeah, yeah, so like, um, guy Jes and sleeper. They can, so Tony just a lower dose, it doesn't work as a contraception, but can be fairly effective or pain and bleeding. Slender is a stronger one of those. Um, yeah, that could get me too.Patient: minutes to this so far as like plus resis, um, where, yeah, uh, my left hand side of my face and um, that's why you is going numb and had a bigger drop to it and things, um. And, uh, some like the clarity of memory when that happens. Various across various parts of my body, like can't really, like it's reduced sensation in the brain responses, um. And reduce the temperature. Um, and it was this other thing where um, when we look at, if you look at like private checklist is kind of all the signs of MS. Um, it kind of seems to get each of them, um, but again it's something of like, so things for me also I think so, yeah. Um, is that still being explored? I've got the, um, MRI. The brain and spinal cord. In a couple of weeks and then I'll get a follow up with the neurologist. Yes, EEG, MRI and um ultrasound of that. Well, yeah. I think I was to check the like things yeah, I think on that day when I got it done, um, I think when I, before I went to the military, it was something like 400 mLs and I got it and then afterwards, and it was 7 nose and stuff like that, um, yeah. I find it, um, yeah, um, and it can feel quite like it can be hard to go to. It's like, um, I will, um, not, um, it'll be hard to tell if I have emptied my bladder. Um, and so um, like yeah, like it can, so you, it could require more accession as well, so sometimes it's like also just like. I it's like I'm not, yeah. Occasionally, yeah. Yeah, and, um, in the past I've had pan of course it's been very painful, um. I've been, I got referred to get checked for adenomyosis and maybe an ultrasound and didn't find anything, so. Yeah. And my sister had as well. They're not, so they're quite heavy, but relative to when I wasn't on tea, they're not as heavy. Is like they used to be not so yeah. That's some work, you know, can you be on, uh like a like progestin, so I think we can if you want that. I've had it like a progesterone based on interact quite bad with LSM most things in terms of. few things, um, yeah. 61.Doctor: That's probably a question for you gender.---3000,3300Doctor: That's probably a question for you gender is that just not sure how they interact, yeah, um, that's pretty sure it's done. What are the things that you should salt? I can like pro the therapy it's, it's dextro it's high concentrates designed to try and time enough. What a scarring designed to try and high enough join some houses. They can be a bit sometimes I've had a few people just flare like crazy from it. I think you can get away with sweeping it. Actively held together. Pro, but some people like Fraser Burling. I like so far I've tried to do like straight sort of work on it. That's where it's gonna be like careful. Of that OK, yeah. It's not obvious that. So that's where the compression socks can be helpful, I guess if you get the sensation of it, but it's just not much in terms of helping with your head, not so much. How do you find the decks in terms of helping you energy wise, you're pretty low dose.Patient: Like I don't know folks that have been on, I'm not sure like what dose of testosterone you now too. But yeah, I'll talk it out, um. Yeah I find it like when. And like your face, it'll be like everything does absolutely just tend to flare, um. Looks good, yeah, routinely but um. And yeah, like the impact of like drugs and everything like I get a little like sofas and dislocations. Loss, um, when I saw that little subs and just like a pretty frequently and have I just got that in on my own. Um my hips, um, outside kind of area people also kind of the parents like groups of the area, and my knees little bit, um, my ankles roll very easily, um, with right holders, um, no. Um, where it's when I they will also sometimes dislocated it, um. And it is all that is all. I do think I very much noticed since I've had to start on it's just like. I hadn't realised how protective that was in terms of things and I'm just like, oh, OK. Yeah, and it was quite a lot. I will have. With a crashing. Oh wow. Yeah, and there are times that sometimes like I'll be this little voice in my head it's like maybe, maybe I just, you know, you got me wrong and I'm just, you know, I'm not trying enough and I look at my like yeah yeah, so I find it. I so and quite mindful of, um, I can't refer to it as like not getting like false sense of capacity from sex, um. And when I am having I crash. I find that like um. Like there will be days where, for example, like if I've taken my dicks, but.---3300,3600Patient: And having a crash, it will be like oh you know kind of affection the exs whatsoever, like they'll be kind of times where like I physically commonly keep my eyes open, it just so it feels like I made a be and so like. OK just pull down the like having to sleep sort of thing, um. Yeah, and so, yeah, that's definitely does help with. And, um, I'm walking crash, um. Yeah, OK, so like relative to how any energy levels used to be, um, it's a very solid distance, yeah. I think so. Yeah. My GP, yeah, Doctor Thomason checks like that's pretty comprehensive. Um and the most recent one, I think she described them as comedically normal, um. Yeah, there has in the past been times when I, um, one of my thyroid things, I think AST, that's consistently been up and down over the years, um, and sometimes I think white blood cells have been lower. Intimately, um, and red blood red blood cells apparently sometimes they're lower in number, but bigger in size or something. I can't remember what it was, um, but yeah, generally lots of fine and no any year or anything like that. Yeah. It does, that doesn't seem to be so much a problem these days as it would have been like a few years ago.Doctor: So what should we do. So I think we'll start. We do, and abdominal x-ray. Have you had all the bloods? I might do some random weird gloves. And we'll do the Addo X-ray. Um, so yeah, if you're all jammed up, we'll kind of do a laxativeity sort of programme to clear that out. Loads of people actually completely jammed up and they had no idea. X-ray, yeah, 90% of people I have kind of scan? I have been backed up. So what happens is you've got this chunk there which is essentially concrete in. And you're kind of sit there and that's when you feel constipated and then the stuff builds up and then eventually, you get this overflow, so you get diarrhoea. And so people are like, oh, that's cleared out, but it hasn't fundamentally changed. OK. So I'll get you to. I'll give you a bunch of things to fill out. So we'll do an MCAS form and some sleep stuff. Usually like you get a form of slips. study. Cool. So that's your X-ray. Uh. The pelvic floor physio might be helpful. Um, CMJ physio. considering Botox around here.Patient: I feel like I can definitely get good dietician recommendations because my father is a neurofiing dietician who works right in the frozen space.Doctor: Oh, awesome, yeah, I tend to use a group called Savvy. OK, yeah.Patient: They're up in Queensland and that would be good because yeah, I know so many of the ones that are in Nam, like, yes, they're having else would be good, yeah.Doctor: Um, oh, we're going to consider.---3600,3900Doctor: Yeah, so I was thinking. So some people front load the decks in the morning. Yeah, bigger dose to try and get that boost in the morning. Sometimes you'll find that. But that's touch is how kind of. Race makes you. Um, so that's a consideration. It's a drug you're already on so I can help. like, how do you feel your pulse is well controlled? Other things we could consider would be uh hydrocortisone. So I quite like that one, and I actually think it's really important to have. So that's the one which holds onto salt, so it retains fluid. And so part of the problem in typing, that's the thing is. Like if you drink a lot, but it will come straight out. And so it doesn't really matter how hard you squeeze the veins, you've got no blood to push up. So you need to turn off the tap, that's what flu report does. So I think it's important to have that. Cause yeah, otherwise you're kind of, you know, you squeeze as hard as you want, you know, you try and drop your heart rate, you don't have enough fluid, so you need to turn up the tap it. So I think it's important to have that. Um, so you titrate it against how frequently. So it hangs around forever, um. That depends on the people person, so like for me, I use it once every week or so, basically, I told you about like, like, I'm going to the toilet more. It's time to have one and then that that holds me out for a week. You can't type the tap any further, as it were, so there's no point like having a really high dose if you don't need it. And then you get the side effects of weight gain and all that sort of stuff. So I basically say you go on your frequency and it's kind of nice and controlled, that's probably the right dose, let's try some amitriptyline. And see if that helps your headache. That might help you sleep as well. Um, you can consider would be like having your head up a bit in your bed, um, doesn't sound like you have too much of a problem. There's a thing called pressure diuresis. So what happens is because your blood pressure's low, during the day. Yours isn't too bad. And then you lie down, your blood pressure goes up. So it's more blood pressure and your kidneys are like, oh no, I've got too much fluid it all out overnight and you wake up and you feel like an ass. So it just doesn't, it sounds like you're not having that. I've got people who wake up twice in the night. So yeah, um. OK, so yeah, we'll do that. I'll give you, um, there's a couple of myths. For you. I'll get you to fill out the MCAS form and a whole bunch of other ones. And then we'll consider starting. Um, and cats meds. Um, and maybe like a sleep study and that sort of thing, um, make the sleep study sound good and then you might get a bulk billed. Um, and um, what else? We could start low dose naltrexone. Have you heard of that one?Patient: At the moment it's, so yeah, since I've had the Merine added in and think that's helped a lot, um. It seems, I think at the moment it seems to be going OK. I am not sure though sort of want to be like getting into summer and things, um. Yeah, the kidney, I guess like kidney, keeping an eye on it, um. That makes sense. Um, I have, yeah.Doctor: Any questions on that?Patient: What I, I know like, I don't know a huge chunk about it, um, but I know that it's often so, yeah, prescribed in context, like, yeah.---3900,4200Doctor: Most well known for chronic fatigue. So yeah, we start with low doses, I tend to use an oil to begin with, um, just easy to titrate. Some people are really sensitive to it. Yeah, so you start at 0.5 milligrammes, you work your way up to a max of 10, um, take one day off a week, and then when you find the dose which works best for you, then we get that compounded capsules rather than having, you know, 1000 capsules, which is annoying. And I'll send you the compounding pharmacies that I use, um, probably what we get, we'll get the MAS stuff first. Some other meds which can sometimes help like um stigmin, so that helps get your guts moving and it's also quite good for some people in pots just for one. Uh, and worked great for the fatigue. So yeah, she was quite beautifully to that so that's um and if you've got a bit of blood problems, it can sometimes help with that, so I'll keep that in mind. How often do you see a cardiac? OK, so yeah, and there'll be a bunch of referrals for people that I kind of know and this um. So we get a few minutes. I'll send you a whole bunch of tests and stuff and some forms to fill out and then we'll catch up and then kind of keep trucking away. Uh, yeah, you reckon you'll get that 4 to 6 weeks is usually when we catch up, um, so if that comes back super exciting. I'll organise a telehealth and we'll just get you going so we'll clear that, um, for next time. Sounds like you've had all the cardiac investigations. I don't think you need to really look at that. So yeah, email is <REDACTED PII>. I'm probably too lazy to look up everyone else's contact details, but um it's your letter, so I do encourage you to show it to whoever needs to see it, um, so that everyone's kind of in the loop.Patient: What I, I know like, I don't know a huge chunk about it, um, but I know that it's often so, yeah, prescribed in context like this, yeah. That was the one that my friend really need me pick up for them like, yeah, um, and we are very happy to try. Yeah, I think like, I think I'm often sitting in a space of sort of never feeling like I'm able to kind of like. So not downtime for a couple of things and then with that fatigue, it's, yeah, that catch like it makes it very, very hard to work and things. So not being able to take time off work because it's um. So yeah, the mountain because that's what, that's the thing it's like often it's like more of my job like 500 minutes in a day and I'm gone kind of thing. I'm like, yeah, like when I have like several nights I'll be like I'm yeah, like I kind of work Mondays through Wednesdays, and they typically spend the rest of the week recovering and things. Yeah, it would be cool to be able to not be so fatigued. Um, every 3 to 6 months. I don't think so. Yeah. Thank you so much, pleasure. Thank you. Um, that we do open up, please. About. So I worked in. Yes, yes."

He reports significant fatigue and a pattern of \"crashing\" after physical or mental exertion. He has been experiencing migraines approximately every 4 to 6 weeks, which he finds difficult to manage. Additionally, he has gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with suspected celiac disease, including nausea, cramping, and bloating, which have been present since childhood. He has a history of seizure-like activity, particularly when transitioning from sitting or lying down to standing.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Assessment:</h4>\n  <p>On examination, the patient exhibits signs consistent with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and possible autonomic dysfunction. He has been managing his symptoms with a variety of medications, including sertraline, propranolol, and clonidine, but continues to experience significant challenges with fatigue, migraines, and gastrointestinal issues. An abdominal X-ray is planned to assess for constipation, which may be contributing to his symptoms. The patient is also scheduled for an MRI of the brain and spinal cord to further investigate his neurological symptoms.</p>\n  \n  <h4>Past Medical History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</li>\n    <li>ADHD</li>\n    <li>Chronic migraines</li>\n    <li>Gastrointestinal issues (suspected celiac disease)</li>\n    <li>Seizure-like activity</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Family History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Family history of autoimmune conditions (specifics not provided)</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Social History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Works as a clinical psychologist</li>\n    <li>Living alone but moving in with partner</li>\n    <li>Has a pet dog</li>\n    <li>Engages in limited physical activity due to fatigue</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Medications:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Sertraline 25mg daily</li>\n    <li>Propranolol 5mg three times a day</li>\n    <li>Clonidine 0.5mg at night</li>\n    <li>Finasteride 1.25mg daily</li>\n    <li>Metoclopramide as needed for migraines</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Allergies:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Penicillin (causes rash and welts)</li>\n    <li>Oxycodone (causes severe reactions)</li>\n    <li>Various environmental allergens (pollen, dust, adhesives)</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <h4>Investigations:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>EEG - performed (results pending)</li>\n    <li>MRI of brain and spinal cord - scheduled</li>\n    <li>Abdominal X-ray - planned</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>I would greatly appreciate your clinical review and assessment, and any ongoing management that you may consider necessary.</p>\n  <p>Kind Regards,</p>\n</body>",

I, I noticed them when I wake up. And is there anything that makes them better? Well, if I lie down for a while, they seem to get, they go away, yes.

It's quite normal, 70 per minute. Now your blood pressure. Fine, that's quite normal too. 130/80. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. So I want you to breathe normally. Your heart sounds quite normal. Now I want you to take deep breaths in and out, while I check your lungs. Fine, they're completely clear. Well, Mister Green, uh, the pain you've been having sounds very much like the pain of what we call angina. And this, uh, well, this occurs when not enough oxygen is getting to the heart.

Yeah, since I've been trying to sort out the garden of my new house and I don't know. I may have been overdoing things a bit. Well, I sometimes get a bit of indigestion. But it only comes on if I have something spicy, you know, like a curry. Not bad. Ah, they're all right. No, they stopped. Must have been 5 years ago. Not really, Doctor. Only when I've got a cold. No, I can't say that I have really. I've been feeling a bit down. You know, um, not sleeping well. Oh, I don't know exactly about 2 months on and off. Well, sometimes I'm all right during the day, but I wake up at night and I'm drenched in sweat, drenched and sometimes my whole body shakes. Well, I don't know. I've been feeling a bit tired. A bit tired and weak and I just don't seem to have any energy. Yes, well, actually I have a bit, yes. Yes, yes, I have about a stone. Well, I've really been off my food this last while, I just haven't felt like eating. Oh yes, I have nearly all the time. I sometimes bring up a lot of phlegm. No, not always, but yes, sometimes. I take a deep breath. Hello, Jim. I wonder if you could see a patient for me. Well, it's a Mr. <REDACTED PII>, a 53 year old carpenter."

Good afternoon, Mr. Hudson. Just have a seat. I haven't seen you for a good long time. What's brought you along here today? And have they affected your vision at all? Now you told me that you've lost some weight. What's your appetite been like? And what about your bowels? Any problems? And what about your waterworks? has this come on recently? And do you get any pain when you're passing water? And have you noticed any blood? Any traces of blood? Examining a patient. Would you slip off your top things, please? No, I just want to see you standing hands by your side. You're sticking that hip out a little bit, aren't you? Could you bend down as far as you can with your knees straight and stop when you've had enough? That's the limit. Not very far, is it? Now, I would like you to lean backwards. It's not much either. Now, stand up straight again. Now, first of all, I would like you to slide your right hand down the right side of your thigh. See how far you can go. That's fine. Now, do the same thing on the opposite side. Fine. Now, just come back to standing straight. Now keep your feet together just as they are. Keep your knees firm.

It's been so severe. And he's also noticed some tingling in his right foot. He's having difficulty in carrying on with his work. He's also lost 3 kg and has become quite depressed. No, not exactly, but he has suffered from intermittent pain in the back, paracetamol gave some relief, but didn't solve the problem completely. No, perfectly OK. Yes, as well as the pain, he has numbness in his toes on the right foot. Well, Doctor, I've been having these headaches and um, I seem to have lost some weight and I see. Well, um, I don't know, for quite a while now. The wife passed away, you know, about 4 months ago and I've been feeling damned since then. Uh, just here. Just here on the top.

Would you like to lie down here on the couch? On your back, OK. I'm going to test your reflexes by tapping you with this little hammer. It won't hurt you. Let me hold your right arm. I let it go quite relaxed. Try not to tighten up. Now the other one. Just let me have your wrist. Let it go quite floppy. That's right. I'm going to tap your elbow. Fine. Now the left one. OK. Fine. I'll just give you a little tap here on the wrist. Now, the other one. Now let your legs go completely relaxed. I'll hold them up with my hand. I'm just going to turn your leg out to the side for a moment. Just relax. That's it. Now, the other one. Fine. Firstly, I'd like you to kneel on that straight backed chair so that your feet are just slightly hanging over the edge. That's right. Now I'm going to tap them behind your heel with this hammer. This is just a method of testing for your ankle jerk. That's fine. Now I'd like you to sit with your legs just dangling over the edge of the couch so that I can test your knee jerks. Now nothing very much is happening here, so what I'd like you to do is to clasp your hands together with the fingers and try to pull your fingers apart. Pull as hard as you can and concentrate on pulling. That's fine. That makes it a lot easier to produce your knee jerk. Now, finally, I want you to lie down on the bed with your legs stretched out in front of you. Now I'm going to place my hand on your knee. And with this key, I'm going to stroke the sole of your foot to see which way your big toe will turn. This is called the Plantar reflex. You shouldn't find it painful, although it may tickle a little. Fine. Now I'll check the other foot. Very good. That's your reflexes all finished now. Thank you. Would you like to get onto the couch and lie on your back, please? I'm going to take your left leg and see how far we can raise it. Keep the knee straight. I'm going to bend your knee. How does that feel? Now let's see what happens when we straighten your leg again. I'm just going to press behind your knee. Where does it hurt? Right. Now, would you roll over onto your tummy?

I'll give you an injection to relieve the pain and arrange for you to go into hospital for further tests. I'll just check a few things to see if we can get to the bottom of these problems. First of all, I'll check your pulse, and then I'll do your blood pressure. I'd like you to take off your jacket and roll up your sleeve. It's just a little above normal, but that doesn't mean too much. If you'd like to roll up your shirt, I'm going to check your heart and lungs. Now, just breathe normally. Good.

I measure from the top of your womb to your pubic bone. The number of centimetres is roughly equal to the number of weeks you're pregnant. In your case, it's 29 centimetres, but you're 32 weeks pregnant. Why do you think the baby's small? Oh, it might be because your dates are wrong. Remember you weren't sure of your last period. The best thing would be to have another scan done. I'll make an appointment for you next week. Which way round is the baby lying? The baby's in the right position. It's coming head first. Now I'm going to listen for the baby's heartbeat. That's fine. Can you hear it? Yeah. Have you noticed any swelling of your ankles? Not really. Let's have a quick look. No, they seem to be all right.

Right now, lie still. That's very important. This test is to help me get a picture of the inside of your gullet and your stomach, so that we can find out what's causing you these pains there. I want you just to stand here while I give you a cup of liquid to drink. This liquid will show up after you've drunk it, and will be able to tell me if you have an ulcer in your stomach or duodenum. I'd like you to drink the liquid now. I'll be taking pictures of it as it goes down. Now, I'm just going to give you a little jab to help your tummy relax. Just a little prick. OK? Mhm. That's fine. Good girl. Now, I want you to open your mouth for me so that I can pass this little tube down into your tummy. That's fine. Good girl. Nothing to worry about. Head back a little. That's fine.

Then for 3 mornings running, I'd like you to bring to the surgery a sample of the phlegm that you cough up in the morning. We'll be sending that off to the lab for testing to see if you have any particular germs present. Following that, it'll be necessary for you to have a bronchoscopy done. This is an investigation which involves looking down into your lungs through a tube. We'll have to admit you to hospital for the day to do it. It's not a particularly pleasant investigation, but you'll be given an anaesthetic spray before the tube is passed down into your lungs. Usually, it doesn't take more than a few minutes, but it may last longer if they need to take samples of the tissue in your lungs, maybe up to 20 minutes. You have to take this test with an empty stomach, so you won't have any breakfast that day. You'll be able to get home again after the test, but you'll have to wait until the anaesthetic has worn off before you eat anything."

When you lift it, the nerve gets trapped and it's very sore. When I bend your knee, that takes the tension off and eases the pain. If we straighten it, the nerve goes taut and it's very painful. Now what is trapping the nerve? Well, your MRI scan confirms that you've got a damaged disc in the lower part of your back. The disc is a little pad of gristle which lies between the bones in your spine. If you lift heavy loads in the wrong way, you can damage it. And that's what's happened to you. You've damaged a disc. It's pressing on a nerve in your spine so that it can't slide freely. And that's the cause of these pains you've been having."

He also reports a sensation of deafness noted by his wife. Additionally, he has a history of chest pain, which he describes as severe and occurring during physical exertion, lasting about 10 minutes. He has experienced tingling in his fingers and right foot, along with significant weight loss of 3 kg over the past two months, and has been feeling depressed since the passing of his wife four months ago.</p>\n  <h4>Assessment:</h4>\n  <p>On examination, Mr. Hall's vital signs were stable, with a normal pulse and blood pressure. His heart sounds were normal, and lung examination revealed clear breath sounds. The pain in his chest is suggestive of angina, likely due to insufficient oxygen reaching the heart. The neurological symptoms, including tingling and numbness, may indicate a possible nerve compression or other neurological issue. Further investigations are warranted to assess his cardiac and neurological health.</p>\n  <h4>Past Medical History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Appendicitis (childhood)</li>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Family History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Social History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Works as a carpenter</li>\n    <li>Recent bereavement affecting mental health</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Medications:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Aspirin (as needed for pain)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Allergies:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Investigations:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>ECG and chest X-ray to assess cardiac function</li>\n    <li>Neurological assessment to evaluate tingling and numbness</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>I would greatly appreciate your clinical review and assessment, and any ongoing management that you may consider necessary.</p>\n  <p>Kind Regards,</p>\n</body>",

Uh, just increasing cholesterol and probably the big one is triglycerides? Uh, and you're heading towards diabetes as well. The HBA1C doesn't change, well, it lasts for 3 months, so it's not something which changes rapidly. Um, and it's been heading up since last year. So I think that's a trend. And then you had your colonoscopy. Is he doing anything about it? So he's going to see you again or what's my first? It's really unclear because like actually says high grade dysplasia. Which I don't like, that means that they are getting weirder. Like this, this isn't, you know, it's just a significant polyp to remove the colonoscopy. It doesn't say what else he wants, sir. What he wants to do about it. Because sometimes when you go to like the high grade range they want you in yearly. I'll email it as well because that's kind of, it's like pretty useless freaking letter. I mean, it's low grade, I'd be much less excited. So hi, so basically he goes low, medium, high cancer. Alright, so you're right, that's just like, oh, so some people like, no, we're gonna do this yearly until we're clear, some people are like, yeah, I just want to.Patient: Um, I am kind of wound up at the moment, so you want to do it, do you want to do it 24 hour? I don't think it's gonna prove anything that we don't already know. OK. I mean, you were considering, you said to be seriously considering blood pressure tablets. I think I do need them. Well, I was diagnosed as type 2 diabetes years ago. Um, and I was able to sort of keep that under control, but like I said, when I had those tests, I was, I was being really bad. I'm still not real good. In the report that I got, he said he found 5 polyps, I think it's a whole bunch they were uh they weren't a major concern. But um, and he didn't give me a, a another appointment to come back in 2 years, but, I presume that it's ongoing for my age. Yeah, when he spoke to me after the procedure, he seemed pretty relaxed. And the time before, uh, we found some larger polyps and he was, he seemed a little more concerned then, so. I, I contact these officers and find out. Yeah, I just took these kind of relaxed tone after the procedure that day wasn't too concerned. Um, and that, um, what he was writing in the letter was, credible standard for someone my age with my history. Hm, kind of what his history, you know, you know, my mum had um bowel cancer and that uh she was, theatre an operation for that um. So he's, he's, you know, well aware of family history.00:05:00 - 00:10:00Doctor: Heading well towards the diabetes, metabolically syndrome sort of thing. I think we should do something about that. So, I think blood pressure is a good thing to do to keep your kidneys safe. Something for the cholesterol to try and kind of just get a lid on that. And then I guess the options for, so technically you're not diabetic. But you're heading that way and I guess in my mind, diabetes like the set cut off at 6.5 for HP once a year at 5.9. Normal is 5.5. But it's probably not good being in that middle; it's not like everything's fine and then everything. Yeah, so you're halfway, halfway to making an official either way I'm more likely to fall the wrong way. Almost certainly will go the wrong way. Yeah, so that's kind of an arbitrary cut off. So I'm pretty aggressive about it because it's just a heck of a lot easier early than it is later. The thing is you're accumulating damage that whole time. You know, it's not like suddenly everything's fine, then everything's horrible. Things are getting progressively worse; you've got the sugar running around gumming up your plumbing. So there's a few options ranging from kind of cheap to expensive. Cheap is like metformin, which is your baseline standard sort of drug. You don't have any evidence of like kidney injury or anything like that yet, so that's good. So I'd say probably that's not a bad option. The kind of deluxe option is one of those new weight loss drugs. So like aic or um to zepotide. The big thing about them is that they help you lose weight; we know that carrying weight is one of the risk factors of diabetes. Yeah, that's good stuff that if you can lose 10 to 20% of body weight, all the risks drop back down. And that's kind of what these drugs offer. Mhm. They're expensive and they're an injection; it's probably the downside of it. Cost is roughly 450 to 650 a month. So you're looking at about 100 bucks a week. It kind of depends. Like if you do a takeout or two, that kind of works out that ongoing for life doesn't have to be, so it kind of depends on you, really. I mean I can't afford a lifetime of it. Yeah, so kind of depends on how good a change we manage to make. You know, if you use it for a few months and you manage to lose 10 kg and lifestyle-wise we manage to get everything else under control, you know, then you can probably come off it. You will likely regain some, but like, and that's kind of why I quite like the medication is it actually gives you a chance. If you can lose a chunk of body weight and then make some good changes, diet, exercise, all that, which is often easier when you're carrying a bit less weight. You know, I've got a couple of guys around there, 140 kg, so they can't do any exercise. He has a catch 22; they need it and they can't do it. Yeah, so that's kind of what I see it's useful. Some people like they just can't and so you end up being on it for life, though I'd expect most people. Like, so I've been using, I use to Zappatide more because it's got more weight loss potential; they quote it up to 20% like it's huge. And often even just a smaller doses, which I think are only 360 bucks that it's cheaper, because it goes from 5 milligrammes, 2.5 milligrammes up to 15, 15 is 645 is cheaper. I've already had stellar success just fiddling around the 2.5s for guys who've lost about 10 kilos in 2 months.Patient: Yep. Right. Oh, I can't afford that. A month, yeah. I mean I can't afford a lifetime of.Patient: So anticipate they'll probably stay on.00:10:00 - 00:15:00Doctor: So anticipate they'll probably stay on for maybe 6 months maybe 6 to 12. One of the interesting things about these medications, most people report craving less food. Actually reduces that kind of. Is it a habit? I'd prefer you to have nuts and jerky and that sort of stuff. So they did a good study in Google, so it's the same thing because there's a policy in Google you can't be more than 30 metres from a snack. So the snack sections put in everywhere. Everyone can have diabetes and everything because I had like all the bowls of M&Ms and pretzels and all this stuff. I still want to give people a choice, but it is cool behavioural thing where they just put it under the table. All the soft drinks were behind opaque glass, you know, water was visible, Healthy snacks were visible and that actually makes a significant difference because fundamentally we're fairly lazy creatures, you go for the available. So one of the strategies is to just make it harder to get. There are also time lock saves you can get. So, you know, you can only once a day or. Yeah, um, so yeah, look, there's strategies like that, so like, you know, putting them in under some sort of, just makes it harder.Patient: My big problem is discipline. I know I eat badly. I eat well, but I know I eat a lot of sweet stuff as well. And I don't exercise as much as I should. You know, I'll go for walks but not, not uh, I might go for 5 in one week and then I do one for a week. So I know that routine item with the routine and I with the regular diet. I don't know, maybe if I lost. Mine's not even a craving, mine is like I'm a picker. I'll go past food, pick it up and eat it. And I'll pick up the stuff that I can eat with one hand, you know, I'll grab biscuits or a bit of cake or something like that, whatever's around that's easy to consume. I don't have to sit down with a, I don't have to peel an orange, and I don't have to wash an apple and all that sort of thing, I just pick it up and eat it. I used to have a lot of nuts, and that helped keep my cholesterol down. I haven't been having as many nuts recently as what I used to. I used to have a day job where I can't be peanuts. Oh no, it was almond cashew walnuts, walnuts. They're really good walnuts here. I knew the ones that helped keep the cholesterol down so I would eat those. But I had a desk job and I could keep the nuts on the desk and I could eat them. I'm doing more manual work now, so it's hard to walk around with a pocket full of nuts and what it is to have butts in your desk. So that's part of the reason that the snacking has become different. You can have a packet of Tim Tams in the pantry for a month unopened but you opened and I, and I'll finish them off within a couple of days. So you know it's just, it is my lack of discipline. I went through this thing where I was slicing up apples and other fruit and having that just sitting in a plastic tupperware. And that made it easier, you know, to grab a bit as I was going. But you know, laziness, I fell out of that habit. Sounds like you'd really like me to do on that. Not the ascentic but the other patide, no, it's an option. I do appreciate it it's expensive. I guess, putting it into context though, I mean, I want my lifestyle, you know, we eat out like once or twice a week, we'll have takeaway. I didn't do that, I could easily afford. I'm 70, I haven't changed yet. What's the likely to be to make those changes and so sometimes.00:15:00 - 00:20:00Doctor: We start with blood pressure. I'm going to make another appointment with you to see about this, um, I think you've got trigger thumb. Yeah, and then if that doesn't work, do you do that here?Patient: Oh yeah, I can give you a referral to just get it done over radiology place. It might be easier. My son <REDACTED PII> works at um, <REDACTED>, and because he's a staff member there, I can get treatment a discount or for free. Yeah, is there a possibility of seeing someone there or is it better places to go? OK. I had a tennis elbow, uh, an injection for tennis elbow at one stage, and they made it sound like, you know, a weird science that that um, that only the best can perform. I don't think I actually had it, but I was right on the edge. Could have been 10 years ago. Is metformin the um a drug that prevents people using things like, uh, eos?Doctor: Oh yeah, I can do them. It's a piece of piss, so easy. Technically speaking, the procedure, it's super easy. No, nowhere near that exciting. I mean, look, of course you can cock it up, but it's really not that hard. OK, so medication wise, blood pressure, cholesterol and I'll start you on the metformin. Were you officially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at some point? Doesn't really matter.Patient: Is metformin the drug that prevents people using things like EOs and antacids and? That's Enos. What's you know? Oh, it's a there's some drink to relieve.Doctor: No.Patient: So many stupid formulations of this.Doctor: You mean?Patient: Arginine.00:20:00 - 00:25:00Doctor: Yeah, so whatever's easier for you, but I suspect it'll be easier getting it and cheaper getting in it. More than the other place that will do a bulk build is vision radiology. I don't know what iMed will do for you. And I've sent you the scripts. No problems with your legs? Excellent. No worries, so, um, see how all that stuff's going in and out. I'll give you a blood test form. And we'll just check on how it's all going in about months. Have a think about whether you want to do anything. Um, have we ever done a calcium score for you? It's about 300 bucks and looks at to see if you've actually got clogging up in your. I mean, you're already on treatment, um, I suppose it'll dictate to them how excited you get? I mean, yeah. I'll give you a form, you can have a think about it. Um, the main use is for people who are not keen on starting things where if you're happy enough to start the additional benefits probably low, unless it shows I guess if it shows a really high, you know, we might push you along. Do you have any problems when you're doing your manual work, like do you get any chest pain or anything like that? OK, yeah. So we'll do the blood test in about 3 months, so I will do that, but.Patient: OK. Yeah, I just got them. Thank you. No, that'd be great, great. All right. No. Yeah, didn't have that done, he was good for her. Yeah I should do one at some stage. Ha. I don't get chest pain, no, but like I'm, I'm an asthmatic and I've always been out of breath easily, um. Symbicort if I'm, I'm doing, yeah, I'm on really, but that's been brilliant. Let's keep the authentic. Uh, like I'm, I'm more of a, I'm, I'm better with lifting weights and picking things up than I am with endurance. January? Anything else I need? Yeah. You. Thanks very much for all of that. It worked pretty well. But yeah, expensive."

We're still working on the system. So what can we do for you?Patient: I'm always just like I say I have a bit of a um, yeah, OK. <Redacted> is a very complex, um, physical and mental health and quite a few um things that we just wanted to run through today to bring you up to speed on the complete situation. There's a few things that we need to get a formal diagnosis for. This is very superficial level what I'm saying right now, but looking to get a couple of things like just some clarity around what's going on for date and some treatment options. She needs a full medication review, um, so needs to link in with the psychiatrist. I'm sure you know what the wait times are like and trying to get in with one at the moment, so, but it's been how many 5 years was it since you had a.Patient: I was there. One of the uh last time I had. And when it was December last year, but it's not really, yeah, but I like it so I, I suppose um the initially like your name came up, um. Even in the context of like I have chronic pain and I have um. Then the pain clinic and from them and then other like all have sort of brought up about um ES and the hyper hypermobility, um, and I've previously been a client at Zebras, um, Australia, um. Pre-pandemic times and stuff, um, and yes, like I don't, I don't even know. Um, and then also like fatigue has been like an ongoing thing.Patient: If it's like fatigue that is chronic or if it's chronic fatigue syndrome, um, I've had like various different tests I did was I going through like pathology that I um have had like over years and I found um one that uh. Sorry, it's a bit rays. Um, and I just printed out all the ones that are from this, but it's like it is from 2021, but um the my GP at the time was like, no, everything was normal, but it did come up with um the the anti-gastrictus. I was this.Patient: And yeah, and I'm just like, oh, that sort of potentially is what I have had like sleep changes done and that's all like everything is like. Um, borderline. Like it's like, oh, you did not narcotic. You don't have breast sleyrome it's like it's all very, yeah. On like, you know, like, yeah, um, I have been diagnosed with FMD, um, and that was the, the episode started back in 2020, um, and I was diagnosed in 2021, um, and the neurologist.Doctor: Um, so probably there's a few things going on. So why do we start with what diagnosis have you got?Patient: OK, um, so. Uh, um. OK. Um, so I was pain wise, I was diagnosed with CRPS in 2013. Um, when I fractured my left tubula. Um, it, it and at dance, um, and then fracture your left fibula. I was doing te on point and I was.Patient: And then um, it was sort of poorly manage, but even from the initial like, the pain wasn't close to the fracture side, it was contagion like my knee and and and my ankle, but it was dancing around and everything, um, and now this is like, because it's.---300,600Patient: Break, the pain wasn't close to the fracture side, it was contagion like my knee and my ankle, but it was dancing around and everything, and now this is like, because it's spread. To every day like oh it's fibre but maybe see I like it, so that's a bit unclear. I was recently diagnosed with POTS or the cer tolerance, the cardiologist sort of put tops on them. He's like officially written off having tolerance.Doctor: Who's your cardiologist? Doctor <REDACTED PII> at um the average. To be honest, it doesn't matter whether it is or isn't. It's just POTS is an extremely narrow thing. So if your blood pressure drops, it's not hot.Patient: Yeah, yeah, like blood pressure doesn't seem to drop but the most recent, like the 24 hour blood pressure thing, I was hypertensive like previously there was like more normal tensive but high heart rate. So we've been put on a sort of initially put on propranolol, TDS, but that hasn't seemed to like helped but not a whole lot.Doctor: We can get on to me, so let's do diagnosis first, so I've got, so there's a chronic pain component which is either CRPS or fibro.Patient: Yeah. Um, and then the fatigue has just been written as chronic fatigue. Further from that.Doctor: When did that start?Patient: Look, I feel like it was before like the pain and before like the injury, but it's definitely worse in the night like. I honestly, I don't even really know like it, yeah.Doctor: When do you think it started becoming a problem?Patient: I sort of like I used to work and I'm not, I'm just starting to work again, but even when I was working it was like I was able to and then I was like crashing afterwards, but that was like also the pain and everything, it's sort of hard to sort of tease it out, but I feel like maybe like 2019.Doctor: OK. And then, anything else? I've got chronic fatigue, we've got a question of maybe hypermobility, got an FND. Like, how does that manifest?Patient: Sometimes it's just like one limb or a combination or like the whole body. Yeah, I like between like 30 minutes to 2 hours, but the longest it's gone on for is like 6 hours time and 5 hours in another. And yeah, it's just sometimes I can sort of feel it coming on and then other times it's just like I just, you can't.Patient: Yeah, and, and it's like sometimes you get like fatigue attacks and is that the FA is that? Chronic fatigue and that's like the fatigue attacks like. I just all of a sudden I can't like hold myself upright, but I can move.Doctor: So what does the paralysis look like in that?Patient: Yeah, it just won't respond to you doing things or you yeah like I feel like it's kind of like Matilda and I'm like I'm looking at like my limb and I'm like move and I can't.Patient: As it's like starting to come good or like back online, it's, I'll get, um, also sometimes it's sort of like a muscle twitch and trying to like capitalise on that and there'll be sort of pins and needles, and then pain and then numbness. And then it's in the cycles through that, and then I'm able to.Patient: Initially they thought it was hemiplegic, but that didn't really because it wasn't basil migraines, which I do get migraines, and so they thought this is like a focal element of migraines.Patient: I did have the genetic test? No.Doctor: Well, I suppose you keep swapping side to side like just an arm, sometimes it's like, like neck down, and then it's like, yeah, like one will come back.---600,900Doctor: Well, I suppose you keep swapping side to side like just an arm. It never affects breathing or anything like that. Who's your neurologist? Dr. <Redacted> or?Patient: Sometimes it's like neck down, and then it's like, yeah, like one will come back online or like no, no. My older brother, but he, yeah, back in 2021, after the diagnosis, he said that there wasn't anything seriously neurologically wrong with me and I didn't need a neurologist, just more psychology. Um, and then I haven't really had a whole lot of treatment in that area since.Doctor: How often do you get them?Patient: Um, I haven't, they've been further and further apart and more sporadic. There was like a period of time where it was pretty regular, like every 3 to 4 weeks it was sort of happening and I was keeping a diary and trying to identify potential triggers and things for it. But yeah, I feel like I've had like a handful this year, which in previous years it would have been a lot higher.Doctor: So this year maybe?Patient: Well, I mean, like I'm, yeah, I feel like it's been a reduction in various different potential triggers. I don't know, I don't know.Doctor: So how many have you had this year?Patient: Um, do you reckon? It's October now. But 5 or 6, yeah.Doctor: When was that diagnosed?Patient: That was diagnosed while I was in hospital for my mental health. They sort of first saw me back in March 2023.Doctor: OK. So restless legs or not quite?Patient: No, like, yeah, I think so. Why are we getting sleep studies? Like I was falling asleep, staying asleep, but waking up exhausted. Sometimes I wake up and I feel more tired than I did at the end of the previous day. Yeah, there was exploring that and I think also there was kind of like with the FND was that epilepsy with cataplexy.Doctor: OK. Where did you get reviewed for that?Patient: Monash, like Monash health. Yeah, um, and like the migraines and such. I did recently go back to the optometrist and I've been trying to explain like with my eyes for a while, but yeah.Doctor: OK.Patient: More recently, the right eye, like the eyeball itself is really painful and that will sometimes lead to a headache, migraine, and everything. That also leads to like there's like a couple of teeth up here. I've had all of my losing teeth removed and sometimes it feels like it's like that wisdom teeth pain, but they're not there, so you know, but they said it's fine. But yeah, and like the sort of double vision and a visual snow.Doctor: And you brought up the visual snow numerous times over the years?Patient: Yeah, and it's sort of been dismissed and like said oh it's like part of migraines and such, but it's there all the time. It's not like an aura of a migraine."

You know, and I think that might be to do with whatever this thing is, but again, it's, you know, where do you feel the stiffness? It's just kind of, you know, when you're bending like elbows and knees and just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know, all over. Yeah, I would say, what day is it today? It's Wednesday, so Wednesdays that would have been it because I was out for my wife's, she was doing this thing with a wee bit of a celebration so we were out for that and I remember saying to her, I was like, you know what, I'm not feeling great, you know, I stuck it out with her, but it would have been that Saturday what's that about 5, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I haven't been, I haven't been, I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife.

Uh, it's, it's, uh, type 2, right, he said I spoke to was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's kind of like. Yeah, when I was speaking to was this, it was another doctor I spoke to a while ago, but when he took my blood pressure and that, he said that was high. Uh, high, higher than it should be. Give me, I'm just gonna check. It's, let me know if I'm pronouncing this correctly because I haven't got my glasses with me, so it's Metformin. That's correct. OK. And, and there's another one less. Lisinopril, I think that's those. I've got them written down a wee bit of papers, so no problem, no problem. That's fine. Anything else, sir? Uh, no, no, just those two. I mean, a wee bit like, you know, a wee bit whatever every now and again, but you know, not nothing long term.

I think you know what you essentially have is a bit of a viral illness, perhaps a bit of maybe early signs of a flu, um, which I think should settle down, um, really on its own over time. Things to, you know, you can do to help yourself, you know, stay rested, drink plenty of fluids. Um, if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial, um, you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. Um, I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a script for antibiotics, which you can maybe use 24 to 48 hours if you don't get better. If I'm still a bit rubbish, then. Yeah, I'll give you a script today. Give it about 24 to 40 hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down, I think there's no harm in starting antibiotics, something like amoxicillin, 1 tablet 3 times a day. Um, if you're still on for next week, come back and see me and we can have another look. Great. Well, I'm glad I could help. And uh, I wish you and your football team all the best."

Yeah, yeah, I mean, mostly dry, you know, it's a wee bit in the morning, it's a bit worse, uh, but I mean, you know, it's, it's fairly, fairly dry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know if it's, you know, not something I would talk about, but yeah, it's a wee bit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I, I, you're right. I’ve had a bit of a sore throat. I mean, I, you know, I’m doing a lot of watching the football as well. So I do a lot of shouting at that, but I'm not sure if that's related or not. Uh, well, it's a team called <REDACTED PII>. They're not even in the top division, uh, of the Scottish League. They're actually in the championship, which is the league below that, and they're bottom of the table. Right. So, I've been a wee bit hoarse because the performance has been, uh, pretty shy, if I'm being honest with you. I mean, I shave every day. So I'm looking at myself. It's not, not, not a pretty sight, to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been a wee bit rough the last few days for sure.

So put weight on it, blowing up quite a bit of fluid in it and she sent me for an X-ray.Doctor: So which foot?Patient: Left foot. Ultrasound, um. So nothing other than information of the um. Yeah, the of the uh around the ankle. Um, I was on pretty much on crutches persisted, um, wasn't didn't do what I was getting any better. Resting elevation. A week later when my regular GP, <REDACTED PII>, she, he, where's she at? <Redacted> ? I. Yeah. Um, by then my foot and actually whole-footed blow up of this man or I couldn't bend my toes.Patient: So before it might be gout, so. She put me straight on to this line. And been on that for 10 days, I just finished tapering that today. And didn't fix the well all the swelling went down, but it didn't fix the prime micro. Only got crutches about a week ago.Doctor: So, OK.Patient: Um, or is that the first time, last Friday was probably the first day I was actually able to put sort of weight on my foot and not have a lot of discomfort, you know, without using the crutches, um, and, and then on with the, you know, been happening the regular physio, but my Achilles was really sore. Um, and, and then for the past week it's been alternating between, my ankle's really sore, like I can't pivot or um, you know, you know, if I try to do it like that position, it really hurts him in the ankle joint and, and then next day went and while Achilles are really sore.Doctor: OK, so tell me how, how did it start? Did it start with an injury or like sprained ankle?Patient: In the past I've had a history of tendonitis in my elbows, but for the past 2 years I've, I've been at <REDACTED PII> and pretty much, you know, gravy.Doctor: So just how did it start?Patient: Now it's, yeah, grand for I wouldn't go for a walk on the beach and, you know, when I got back, my foot was really sore. You know, and really, and then the next day I was struggling to put you back.Doctor: OK. So did it hurt while you were on the walk?Patient: It was uncomfortable. But you didn't, you don't think you rolled it.Patient: Now, it was actually when I set out to go for a walk, so I was a walk on the beach, you said? Do you normally walk on the beach?Patient: And then, you know, it's been in past and this issue about soft sand, you know, and with your bet, you know, and not um because that's why I think up 2 years. To basically strengthen all the muscles and make sure that issues. I tendonitis. That was the first time in a long time you know foot pain.Doctor: OK, but it wasn't too bad that day. And so overnight it got really worse.Patient: Yeah. Take a step back and I, I'm not sure if there's any, any connection whatsoever. I was diagnosed with osteoporosis and same patient I start on <REDACTED PII>. And that week was the first time I took the <REDACTED PII> on a Tuesday. Or ways on some discomfort. I didn't know what was realised what was happening, that was reaction to the <REDACTED PII> that my stomach was just really cramping, and then the next day, 2 days later, I started having more muscle aches and joint pain.Patient: And that persisted with the stomach cramps and joint pain for until the Friday. And also with a coincidence in the Saturday, I ended up with this foot pain. And it blow up from me. So whether it's coincidence, oh, I'm just having a month now.Patient: And all the side effects were tick, tick, tick. I had muscle pain, some cramps, stomach pain. It was pretty bad, I was unwell for a couple of days, basically, you know, took it on a Tuesday and ended up taking, uh, you know, Wednesday.Doctor: Shouldn't cause enoughritis though.Patient: Next day, the other thing, you know, we have physio and, and of course my regular physio <REDACTED PII> is not available because he's sitting down I see an alternative.---300,600Doctor: Yeah. Have you had any other jointty sort of pains or anything like that? So when, let's have a look at your, Oh, I'll get you take the other one off too. All right, let's you go for a bit of a walk. How does it feel first thing in the morning? So just within that day, does it feel good in the morning and then gets worse, or do you feel bad in the morning, gets a bit better, gets bad again? The best in the morning, so it's not particularly sore or stiff in the morning? Let's say you get up in the morning, do you find that you stop limping and then you unlimp? When it was swollen, where were you seeing the s? So, do this for me. Can you get your chart for the back and still get your knees touching there without any, OK, so that's not particularly sore? OK, come sit on the edge here. I, I really don't remember people's names. Can you tell me what, what we did for her?Patient: This which is entirely bouncy. You know, the way this is presented in might be, have you ever thought that it was a rheumatoid arthritis? I don't know. I mean, No, no, it's, you know, at the moment I'm, I've been trying the last few days to walk as normal as possible and just slow down. Um, but you know, just, uh. I feel like I can wake up and turn down and feel it, you know, straight away, and so it's been up and down. You know, and you know, today it's sort of. Probably start off a bit worse than maybe I'd say feels probably yeah, maybe the best in the morning and then if I overdo it. No. I mean, I can still feel that, you know, and I, and I get out and, you know, what's it gonna be tonight, get out of bed, go to the bathroom and thought, OK, is it, is it actually up or is it uncomfortable with my Achilles hurt today or is that the act of the what's being really weird, you know, it's just, and of course once, you know, depending on what happened, it's affected this foot too, because I'm not walking properly. You know, I mean it's been, been weird. Basically the last week. You know, the last week since I've got off current, you know, before that, I couldn't put any weight on it. I literally was, was getting out of bed in the crutches or having the stool I was using the support, yeah, um, you know, I had to go up to <REDACTED PII> and bloody work out outside I be on bloody crutches because every time I I like to drop just too uncomfortable. He said, all the fluid in here, but even in the last few days I've noticed that, you know, it sort of gets big. coffee at, at the end of the day I'm taking my shoes off. Elevate the feet through here. Uh, yeah, and I've been doing, I've been doing calf raises to, you know. Does that hurt? No. Um, up and down. You know, it depends on whether my Achilles is, is really hurting or not.---600,900Doctor: OK, so she's due for sutures out. OK. So, yeah, so is the dressing gown, it's like, do you want me to come have a look? OK, cool. OK, so you want me to come down? OK, thanks. Bye. Cool. Sorry, I just have to see someone downstairs. Just hang out here for a bit. I'll be back. OK, cool. Just hop up on the bed for me. This one, yeah. Was an operation or a cut? tendons don't tend to respond that quickly. Um, why on your tummy for me. This one?Patient: like. Yeah, so. Of this scar. OK. Yeah. I could feel that yeah yeah. more in the. The OK. I can feel the beat that you know like how bad, you know, because I started walking around sort of crutch the first time it's just like. Reading with the draw. To pivot, you know, just really catches them. And, you know, China. Uh, physio, um, inserts in my heel just to raise the heels a bit to try to. Press Achilles. Achilles is not sore. No, it's, it's really weird and it's because we just they doing more car raisers for the past week and I went back in the first time to Pia on Tuesday. And pull back on the whites on you. I was able to do rather than just calf phrases with the election, you can drop it. You've got full range, yeah, and you know, and after that, you know, um, that, that really helped really was the stretched and. heaps of vi.---900,1200Patient: Yeah, that hurts right in the back of the heel. Yeah, that's sort of wobbling, I can feel it, right? It feels like it's right in my ankle. So? Yeah, but the outside of the ankle's OK. It's fine. It's a bit of swelling that you got up. So what in the produce line, I would have thought, you know, 10 days on this I would have really, I mean, the amazing part was within 24 hours, my foot was, you know, I couldn't bend my toes. You know, really the swelling to completely be away next 48 hours and try to walk on it and that was still. You know, so yeah, it goes on, you know, I knew after about 5 or 6 days I thought no it's toilet paper, it's not gonna, it's not gonna fix it completely, so I know I can't keep on taking it. So I started tapering on Friday, Saturday. And so I finished completely, but I'll, I'll start taping, um, meloxicam again last night. No, no, it doesn't keep me awake when you've got weight on it. I'd say, you know, compared to where it was a week ago, it's, you know, it's 90%, you know, better, but it's just still that. The fact is that I will feel to get rid of the crutches last Friday, and here we are Thursday, so still not a week and they're still getting a little bit, it's up and down, that's the thing, it's sort of irritating that, you know, I just feel like, well, I don't feel like it the go and take the dog for a walk, you know, because I don't want to overdo it. Its affect the ankle? Okay, so not just the.Doctor: Heel, OK. I think it's probably worth looking at, you know, any inflammatory arthritis. It's not sleeping magic, but it took all the swelling away, that's, that's not bad. Yeah, so typically with an inflammatory arthritis to worse in the morning, so people were like sucks for a couple of hours, but then it kind of warms up, and the more I move it, the better it feels. So that's more of an inflammatory type process. Gout, to be honest, feels awful all the time. Crystal Laroppies just feel terrible all of the time. Yeah, typically it's only one joint though. I think that's probably not an unreasonable guess as to what went on. Do you have any psoriasis or anything like that? Any rashes? You've still got some swelling, particularly like so when I point your foot. You've got some swelling in the back of the ankle.---1200,1500Doctor: So I reckon where it's at is you've got some fluid in the subtalar joint. Your ankle joint is here, the subtalar joint is here. So your ankle joint is technically this one here, and then somehow they joined this here. It can swell out the back here, so let me point your foot. It gets kind of squashed. This is also the joint where you do that motion, and that can be what particularly walking on beaches can kind of irritate. As I suspect, either you had an inflammatory arthritis or like a gouty sort of condition. So you can get two types: there's uric acid and there's calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition diseases. If it's gout, you can treat it with allopurinol. It's only worth treating if you get it kind of regularly, more than three times a year. If it's like once a year, it's not worth it. Otherwise, it's just kind of do what you've done, like when you get it, just get on the steroids or something, use colchicine for a high dose anti-inflammatory. It will just suck for a while. You've got the crystals there anyway, and your body kind of happily ignores it, and then for some reason, it'll pick a day and just send all the inflammatory things there, and you get this massive swelling. It's often because the subtalar is deep. It's a hard joint to poke. We probably should do a screen of inflammatory markers to see if there is some sort of underlying inflammatory issue. We can do what's called a dual energy CT, which tries to identify if it's gout or calcium pyrophosphate. It uses a special CT machine that fires energy at different levels, and they tell you what sort of crystals they are. If it's calcium, then there's no point treating you for gout. If you're on the mend, it's probably not my choice to do anything more than just doing the anti-inflammatories. If you're walking okay, like if it's still really sore, one of the best things to do is actually stick a needle in it and inject it.Patient: Um, I just discovered all these people I know that I didn't know had gout, and they all got their own advice. One of them was that apparently a friend of theirs had kidney failure after allopurinol. Well, allopurinol, that shouldn't really happen. No, that's the thing when the thing said, you know, Doctor Walpole just doesn't, it's not hot. There was a little bit of redness, but it was more swelling in the ankle. I had something similar a couple of weeks ago. It's not here. Yeah, um, when I went into this thing, it was a reflection. We still.---1500,1800Doctor: Because when it's bad, it hurts so much that the thought of a needle going through that, everyone's like, yeah. Take a pass on that. Some of the red or a high dose anti-inflammatory which works best because it is a profoundly inflammatory sort of process. It'd be good to know which joint it is, um, and it's a bit trickier in the ankle because there's lots of joints, really easy on a big toe, but you probably need like an MRI early to know where the fluid is, so you know which joint to shove it in. That's big joints is not too bad, but again, no one likes it, um, but the fuel energy CT is pretty good. If it takes me 3 weeks? OK. It's not too unusual, but I mean with the 3 weeks on the crutches, and then probably you didn't get onto it early, so I guess the thing is if this happens again, is you want to get onto a high dose anti-inflammatories early. Or though yeah, if you've got osteoporosis, I try and keep you off credit. Now, I've got to say again and say there's not yeah, yeah, there's so you can either do it with like an IV infusion, so you can do like once a year IV. There's a few options, but the problem is if you've got crappy bones, Prednisone is not gonna help that. Topical steroids, uh, it depends on how much really and how often you're needing it. You've got chronic eczema, yeah, yeah. So it's just here and there like. Then yeah, there will be some absorption. Um, so yeah, probably the thing I'd suggest would be. Roxicam doesn't hit fast, that's my main issue, that's my main view for that. Doesn't be fast. It takes about 7 hours to reach peak. So it's not good as an on and off. It's good when you take it regularly. Meloxicam group is a last for ages, but it doesn't kick in quick, so it depends, but a lot of people find that like let's say they're really sore and they take it at night to try and get a better night sleep, it doesn't work. I feel great the next morning, doesn't help that night. If you want to do it on and off, I like either naproxen or um Celebrex or a 12 clock. Um, basically within an hour and they. Celebrates lasts 12 hours, naproxen lasts about 124. I'm quite happy to give you a script of one of those. Next week I'm happy with you on meloxicam, um, you can finish it off, but I guess the next time you kind of wanna hit it. The earlier you can get onto the anti-inflammatories, kind of the less horrible it is, I guess. So like, you know, when you start first few weeks. Get it into you.Patient: Even when it was like I couldn't put weight on her, it didn't hurt to poke. Well, yeah, no, yeah, it was blown up with a puppy and it was sore, you know, it's hard to put weight on it and walk on normally, but I must admit you know. Take a couple of for bloody great. Is the average for yeah, start on grand final day, so here we had too much getting on the 5 weeks. 12 days ago yeah about 2 weeks before. Yeah, I'm supposed to. I know it's supposed to be and I'm not prepared to take the actor. I'll talk about Actonel. Every once a month, once a week. That's part of the reason to osteo. Um, you know, I never thought that, um, topical ointments were an issue, but it's now that it is. Well, I got meloxicam 15 milligrammes. That's what I sort of was doing, and I, up and down depending on whether I was having issues with, you know, 100L but I normally would take it at night. Yeah, uh, that cause I think, you know, maybe for the next, next week to help settle down.---1800,2100Doctor: Do you have any problems with your guts? Do you have any problems with um ulcers or anything like that?Patient: No. No. Now, always make sure I take all my meds with food. Even though proof I make sure that you know on an empty stomach.Doctor: I like Etura Coxi. That's kind of like my favourite. The downside of this one is it's slightly more expensive, um, anti-inflammatory. So the thing is it won't help when you're safety net, so I think it ends up being about.Patient: I'd rather something that's more effective. Yeah, look.Doctor: So the other thing is, I guess all of the anti-inflammatories are a little bit individual. Some people react really well to one and not the others. There is this thing called the um Oxford pain chart where they've tried to rank all of them, and this usually comes out on top. So give it a bro, but if you find like it doesn't do anything, then we'll change it to naproxen or Celebrex.Patient: Sure.Doctor: Do you want a referral to get that CT scan?Patient: Um, you might as well, and then I can decide whether I want to use it or not.Doctor: Yeah, look, it's not gonna tell us anything kind of in the acute sort of setting, it's ready to go.Patient: I'll give it a week, you know, and if it's a thing of that, you know, persisting and I feel like, OK.Doctor: Yeah, look, it's not gonna tell us anything kind of in the acute sort of setting, it's ready to go. I don't know how well it works if it's not particularly pissed off.Patient: OK, so it needs to really identify.Doctor: Probably be more in the kind of pissy sort of state. And then, and like I said, it kind of tells us which way.Patient: Um.Doctor: So it's kind of if we're getting to the point of considering, like we're going to treat you for gout, I guess.Patient: Um.Doctor: It can be school to know to make sure that it is in fact gout. I'll do some bloods as well.Patient: Yeah, I'm due to have blood tests because I've been on vitamin D trying to address some issue with my thyroid response. So we on vitamin D supplements for 2 months and I do that blood test.---2100,2400Doctor: Um. OK. Uh, what's your endocrinologist's name? So, a bunch of blood tests, it'll also look at some of the weird stuff that can happen with risedronate, your bisphosphonate. So we'll kind of help with some of the weird stuff that happened with that and calcium metabolism. Um, this is the dual GCT. No worries. So you go to Keyser, that's right. So Doctor <Redacted> is your endo. Um OK. I'll send a letter to your GP Dr. <Redacted> , and <Redacted>  on planning on doing, um, you should have got the script for your anti-inflammatory um. This one. You can just add them into whatever they're looking at. Um, so yeah, take both in so we don't double up. We don't need 3 vitamin D tests. So yeah, are in that. We'll get better. But yeah, next time you get the first sign of it, just like chopped out some anti-inflamm.Patient: <Redacted> . Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh. Right, uh, cool. Oh yeah. All right, so I, I'll get the blood done, uh, I sort of follow up on the vitamin D that way. Yes, it's a lot of um uh vitamin D as well, so. It's funny, you know, like obviously you don't actually feel like it's loose in the ankle. Yeah, I do a lot.---2400,2700Patient: It's not uncomfortable stepping on it.Doctor: Yeah, feel we get so yeah my foot did something like a couple of weeks ago just like. It occasion that I enjoy, you know. Yeah, I just."

I don't like that it's, you know, it's something I would talk about, but yeah, it's uh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. Is that, is that coming through loud and clear on the phone, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've, I've had a bit of a sore throat. I mean, I'm doing a lot of uh, you know, watching the football as well. So I do a lot of shouting at that, but I'm not sure if that's related or not. Uh, well, it's a team called <REDACTED PII>, and they're in the championship, which is the league below that and bottom of the table. So, I've been shouting myself a wee bit hoarse because the performance has been, uh, pretty shit, if I'm being honest with you wish them all the best. I mean, I shave every day, so I'm looking at myself. It's not, not, not a pretty sight, to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been uh a wee bit rough the last few days for sure. All right, all right, I, I, sorry, you mean like looking uh no, I mean, no, I don't, I don't really like to, you know, to look at it. So I, I haven't, I haven't tried to do any of that we, we always, um, uh, recommend, but it's, um, moving on in terms of your airs any dullness or blocked ears, pain in your ears? Uh, yeah, yeah, a wee bit, I mean, you know, I'm I'm 50 years old now, it's not as good as it used to be, but, you know, I, I think, I think it's all right. It's all right. No, it's, it's, it's, it's not good. It's not good. It's just a wee bit shortness of breath, but it's not, you know, as such. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's, that's definitely something I've noticed, like, you know, in bed with the wife I'm having to, you know, get out and get the blanket off and put it back on again. It's not I mean I'm keeping her up at night as well, which is a bloody nightmare, but I mean, you know how these things are. I mean, no, I mean, you know, I can, I just feel it on my forehead, but a thermometer, OK?"

Yeah, I can certainly here you've got the sniffles, so bit of a runny nose, you mentioned. Any other symptoms, for example, if you had any, uh, any sore throat. Any ear pain? The table, um, so, so you mentioned a sore throat. Um, have you had a chance to look in the mirror. Have you had a look at the back of your throat?

And just remind me, when did your symptoms all start? You say a few days ago? Are you aware of anything like that or symptoms of, uh, is it something you've, you've eaten or have you been travelling recently abroad or? And with prying too much, what were you celebrating? So just moving on, um, when we say past medical history, are you, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? So anything to do with your heart, lungs? Diabetes, right. What type of diet? Is it type 1 or type 2? You've been diagnosed with high blood pressure or, or was it just the one? OK, all right. So in terms of your medications, which medications do you take on a regular basis? Lisinopril, yeah. That sounds like I've got them written down a wee bit of papers, so no problem, no problem.

It's just been a, I mean, again, you know, I'm, I'm getting just a wee bit older now, so it's, it's not something that I was thinking about, but I have, I have noticed that when I, you know, when I'm bending down and you know moving about, it's just a wee bit stiffer than normal. You know, and I, I think that might be to do with whatever this thing is, but again, it's, you know, it's just kind of like, you know, when you're, when you're bending like elbows and knees and just just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know. Try what day is it today? It's Wednesday, so Wednesdays that would have been it because I was out. Yeah, I was having dinner and then, yeah, I think, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have been that because I was out for my wife's, she's, she was doing this wee thing with a wee bit of celebration, so we were out for that and I remember I was like, you know what, I'm, I'm, I'm not feeling great, you know, I stuck it out with her, but I, it would have been that Saturday what's that about 55 days ago, yeah, yeah. No, I haven't been, I haven't been, I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife. I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant went to was like, it was a pretty good, so I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything dodgy or anything like that, but I, I. I don't know, you know, I can see. Well, my wife has just been promoted. So she's now going to be a head teacher of primary school. So yeah, we, we night in the tiles for that. So good. Yeah, I'm a wee bit on the chunky side, you know, uh, you know, I've got a wee bit a wee bit around the midriff, the spare tyres definitely there, uh, and I've got the diabetes. Uh, it's, it's, uh, tight, he said I spoke to was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's, it's kind of, it's, it's kind of like. I, when I was speaking to was this, it was another doctor I spoke to a while ago, but uh, when he took the when he was telling me this as well, he took my blood pressure and that, he said that was, that was high. Uh, high, higher than it should be. So no, no, just, just, just those two. I mean, a wee bit like I, I, you know, a wee bit of aspen or whatever every now and again, but you know, not, not, nothing long term. Uh, not that I'm, not that I'm aware of. I mean.

It's not, not, not a pretty sight, to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been a wee bit rough the last few days for sure. Oh right, right, sorry, you mean no, no, I don't, I don't really like to look, you know, to look at it.

It's just kind of, like, you know, when you're, when you're bending like elbows and knees and just, just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know, all over. Yeah, I would say what day is it today? It's Wednesday, so Wednesdays that would have been it because I was out. It was having dinner and then, yeah, I came, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was. my wife's, uh, she's, she was doing this wee thing with a wee bit of a celebration we're out for that.

No, I haven't been, I haven't been, I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife.

I'm not like, you know, I'm not, not an aki or anything, but just, just, uh, yeah, do like a few, a few pints every now and again. Maybe for like 4 pints on Saturday and then, you know, Sunday as well like. 9 pints in a week, I would say. Uh, every now and again, but I, I, I'm trying to cut that down. I've got a wee, what are those things called the wee vaporizers. I mean, cutting down on the cigarettes, uh, and I just got this wee thing. It's great. It, it's actually amazing, by the way. Right, so, so, so if I, I just, I just lie down and take it easy. Yeah I I yeah, I'll I'll I'll give you a script today. Give it about 24 to 40 hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless run down. I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like amoxicillin, 1 tablet 3 times a day. Right, OK.

It will certainly help your health as well. So just to summarise, I think you know based on your story, um, I'm not, I'm not worried. I think you know what you essentially have is a bit of a viral illness, a bit of maybe early signs of a flu, um, which I think should settle down, um, really on his own, um, things to, you know, you can do to help yourself, you know, you stay rested, drink plenty of fluids. Um, if you're hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial. You mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. I'm, I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but we could think about is giving you a, a script for antibiotics which maybe use next 24 to 40 hours if you're don't get better. Yes, absolutely. Great.

Now, first of all, I would like you to slide your right hand down the right side of your thigh. See how far you can go. That's fine. Now, do the same thing on the opposite side. Now, just come back to standing straight. Now, keep your feet together just as they are. Keep your knees firm. Now try and turn both shoulders round to the right. Look right round. Keep your knees and feet steady. Now try the same thing and go round to the left side. Now back to the centre. Now, would you like to go onto the couch and lie on your face? I'm just going to try and find out where the sore spot is. Would you like to lie down here on the couch, on your back? I'm going to test your reflexes by tapping you with this little hammer. It won't hurt you. Let me hold your right arm. Let it go, quite relaxed. Try not to tighten up. Now the other one. Just let me have your wrist. Let it go quite floppy. That's right. I'm going to tap your elbow. OK, fine. I'll just give you a little tap here on the wrist. Now, the other one. Now let your legs go completely relaxed. I'll hold them up in my hand. I'm just going to turn your leg out to the side for a moment. Just relax. Firstly, I'd like you to kneel on that straight backed chair so that your feet are just slightly hanging over the edge. Now I'm going to tap them behind your heel with this hammer. This is just a method of testing for your ankle jerk. Now I'd like you to sit with your legs just dangling over the edge of the couch so that I can test your knees. Nothing very much is happening here, so what I'd like you to do is to clasp your hands together with the fingers, and try to pull your fingers apart as hard as you can. And concentrate on pulling. That's fine. That makes it a lot easier to produce your reflexes. Now finally, I want you to lie down on the bed with your legs stretched out in front of you. Now I'm going to place my hand on your knee. And with this key, I'm going to stroke the sole of your foot to see which way your big toe will turn. This is called the plantar reflex. You shouldn't find it painful, although it may tickle a little. Now check the output. That's your reflexes all finished now."

Now, let's see what happens if I bend your toes back. Now let's see what happens when we straighten your leg again. Just had to press behind your knee. Now, would you roll over onto your tummy? Bend your right knee. How does that feel? Now I'm going to lift your thigh off the couch. I know you're in some pain, but there are a few things I'll have to check. I'll be as quick as I can. I'll just take your pulse on the other side. Now, your blood pressure. I'm going to check the other side too. Now, I want to listen to your heart. Just breathe normally. Could you sit up a little? I just want to check your lungs, right, doctor? Now I'd like you to take big breaths in and out through your mouth. I'll just take a look at your stomach. Now I'm going to check the pulses in your groynes too. Just roll your pyjama trousers down. Well, I think you've got some trouble with one of your arteries because of your high blood pressure. I'll give you an injection to relieve the pain. I'll arrange for you to go into hospital for further tests. How are you? Have you brought your urine sample? I'll just check it. I just slip off your coat. Urine is all clear. Now, if you'd like to lie down on the couch, I'll take a look at the baby. I'll just measure to see what height it is. The number of centimetres is roughly equal to the number of weeks you're pregnant. In your case, it's 29 centimetres, but you're 32 weeks pregnant. The best thing would be to have another scan done. I'll make an appointment for you next week. This way round is the baby's in the right position. It's coming head first. Now, I'm going to listen for the baby's heartbeat. Can you hear it? Let's have a quick look. Now, would you like to sit up and I'll take your blood pressure? No, I'll take a sample of blood to check your haemoglobin."

Now, because you've been having trouble with your water works, I'd like to examine your back passage. If you roll over onto your left side and bend your knees up. You might find this a bit uncomfortable. That's it, all finished. You can get your clothes on now. Now I've had a letter from your doctor saying that you've been having problems with your sight. I'd just like to examine your eyes and perhaps we could start with the chart. Could you just look at the chart for me? Well, with the right eye, can you see anything? Does that make any difference? What about that one? Does that have any effect? Thank you very much indeed. Now, Daddy, can I have a look at you to find out where your bad cough is coming from? Would you like to stay sitting on mom's knee? Ma'am, to take off your jumper and blouse. I'm going to put this thing on your chest. It's called a stethoscope. First of all, I listened to your front, and then your back. Now I'd like to see your tummy. So will you lie on the bed for a minute? Now, while you're lying there, I'll feel your neck and your arms. Now the top of your legs. Mrs. Thompson, could they be sit on your knee again? I'd like you to hold her there while I examine her ears and throat. Now nearly the last bit. Open your mouth.

I'm not so used to stay down in North High Street, of course, and I used to stay with him. But when I got married, I moved up here. Must be a good number of years. I can't quite remember the time. Do you remember when you were born? What was the year of your birth? Oh yes, I was born in 1913. What month are we in? Oh, yes, I'm an April baby. I was always a night for a baby. Not an April Fool, not the first of April, yeah. Do you remember what time? What was the date? Oh, wing. 17th of April. Well, how old will you be now? Well, I've retired now. I must be about 69, I think. Yeah, I'll be about 69. What year is it this year? You know that? Well, this will be about her. 1989 now, I suppose. And what month? Let me see it.

You mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well 3 days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis. It essentially just the tummy bug or infection of your tummy, mainly caused by viruses, but they can be a possibility of bacteria, uh, causing your symptoms. At this stage, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management, so I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just um making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids, um, uh, there are things like dire light you can get from the pharmacy, which, uh, it's um replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. OK. Um, and if you're having vomiting and diarrhoea, I would say recommend that at first, you know, first couple of days. Yeah. If you feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, uh, 2 tablets up to 4 times a day for the first few days can also help.

Can you describe the pain? Do they come on at any particular time? And is there anything that makes them better? Well, Mr. Holt, I think at this stage, I'll start by checking your ears to see if there's any wax. Come and sit down here. I have a letter from your doctor, and she tells me that you've been having pain in your chest. Now when did you first notice this? Can you remember when it first came on? And how long did it last? So, have you had this, the pain again since then? Oh, I think at this stage I'd like to examine your chest. So, if you could stretch your waist. That's fine, I'll just check your pulse first of all. That's fine, it's quite normal, 70 per minute. Now, your blood pressure. Fine. That's quite normal too, 130/80. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. So I want you to breathe normally. Your heart sounds quite normal, that's a relief. Well, now I want you to take deep breaths in and out, while I check your lungs. But, I completely clear. Well, Mister Green, the pain you've been having sounds very much like the pain of what we call angina. And this occurs when not enough oxygen is getting to the heart. Now, I'd like to check a few tests and following that, I'll be able to advise you."

Yeah, yes, yeah, I often get it when I overdo things. Uh, good morning, I see from your card that you've just moved into the area. Perhaps you could tell me a little about your previous health as I won't get your records for another month or two, and then we can deal with your press problem.

He's been an infrequent attender in the past, but he came to see me this morning complaining of pain in his right leg and in his back. And when did this start? Well, it came on about 6 weeks ago, and to become gradually more severe over the past couple of weeks. Was the pain localised? No, at first he thought he'd just pulled a muscle, but it's got so bad that he hasn't been able to do his work properly. It's also been getting to the stage where the pain is waking him up at night. It's been so severe, and he's also noticed some tingling in his right foot. He's having difficulty in carrying on with his work. He's also lost 3 kg and has become quite depressed. Has he had anything similar in the past? No, not exactly, but he has suffered from intermittent pain in back. The paracetamol gave some relief but didn't solve the problem completely. Apart from that, any other problems with health in the past? OK. Did you find anything else on examination? Yes, as well as the pain, he has numbness in his toes on the right foot."

Well, Doctor, I've been having these headaches and I seem to have lost some weight. And how long have these headaches been bothering you? Well, I don't know, for quite a while now. The wife passed away, you know, about 4 months ago. I've been feeling down since then. And which part of your head is affected? Uh, just here, just here on the top. It feels as if there were something heavy, heavy weight pressing down on me. Have they affected your vision at all? No, no, not even same lights or black spots, nothing like that. And they haven't made you feel sick at all, no. Now you told me that you've lost some weight. What's your appetite been like? Well, yeah, I really haven't been feeling like eating. I've really been off my food for the moment. And what about your bowels? Any problems? No, no, they're random. And what about your waterworks? Well, I've been having trouble getting started and have to get up during the night, um, 2 or 3 times a night. Has this come on recently? Well, no, not exactly, I think I've noticed it gradually over the past few months. Do you get any pain when you're passing water? No, no. And have you noticed any blood, any traces of blood? No, no, I can't say that I have."

Now, I would like you to lean backwards. It's not much either. Now, stand up straight here. Now, first of all, I would like you to slide your right hand down the right side of your thigh. See how far you can go. That's fine. Now, do the same thing on the opposite side. Fine. Now, just come back to standing straight. Now keep your feet together just as they are. Keep your knees firm.

I'm just going to try and find out where the sore spot is. Would you like to lie down here on the couch? On your back. I'm going to test your reflexes by tapping you with this little hammer. It won't hurt you. Let me hold your right arm. I let it go quite relaxed. Try not to tighten up. Now the other one. Just let me have your wrist. Let it go quite floppy. That's right. I'm going to tap your elbow. The left one? OK. Fine. I'll just give you a little tap here on the wrist. Now, the other one. Now let your legs go completely relaxed. I'll hold them up with my hand. I'm just going to turn your leg out to the side for a moment. Just relax. That's it. Now, the other one. Firstly, I'd like you to kneel on that straight backed chair so that your feet are just slightly hanging over the edge. That's right. Now I'm going to tap them behind your heel with this hammer. This is just a method of testing for your ankle jerk. That's fine. Now I'd like you to sit with your legs just dangling over the edge of the couch so that I can test your knee jerks. Now, nothing very much is happening here, so what I'd like you to do is to clasp your hands together with the fingers and try to pull your fingers apart. Pull as hard as you can and concentrate on pulling. That's fine. That makes it a lot easier to produce your meat jerk. Now finally, I want you to lie down on the bed with your legs stretched out in front of you. Now I'm going to place my hand on your knee. And with this key, I'm going to stroke the sole of your foot to see which way your big toe will turn. This is called the Plantar reflex. You shouldn't find it painful, although it may tickle a little. Now I'll check the other foot. Very good. That's your reflexes all finished now. Thank you. Would you like to get onto the couch and lie on your back, please? Now, I'm going to take your left leg and see how far we can raise it. Keep the knee straight. Now, let's see what happens if I bend your toes back. I'm just going to press behind your knee."

I must be about 69, I think. Yeah, I'll, I'll be about 69. Well, there's no doubt the years go by. What year is it this year? Do you know that? Well, this will be about 1989 now, I suppose. And what month are we in? Let me see, it will be the uh uh I can't, can't remember. Well, tell me, is it summer or winter? Oh well, I suppose it's so cold, it must be the winter time. It would be here. January. Is that right? Well, actually, it's February now. But it feels as though it was January, doesn't it? Do you remember what day of the week it is? Or do the days not mean a great deal to you now that you're not working? The day seemed to run into each other. But this will be Tuesday, I think. You don't know. Well, I suppose that Wednesday or Thursday, one day tends to become much the same as the other when we're not working. Isn't that right? Oh, you're right there."

This test is to help me get a picture of the inside of your gullet and your stomach so that we can find out what's causing you these pains there. I want you just to stand here while I give you a cup of liquid to drink. This liquid will show up after you've drunk it and will be able to tell me if you have an ulcer in your stomach or duodenum. I'd like you to drink the liquid now, and I'll be taking pictures of it as it goes down. Now, I'm just going to give you a little jab to help your tummy relax. Just a little prick. OK. That's fine. Good girl. Now I want you to open your mouth for me so that I can pass this little tube down into your tummy. That's fine. Good girl. Nothing to worry about. Head back a little. That's fine. Now, can you swallow for me? And again. Good girl. Now, I want you to try and keep as still as possible. I'd like you to lie down on this table here.

But the chest pain and shortness of breath during exertion are definitely concerning. I haven't noticed any wheezing or other respiratory symptoms besides the shortness of breath. No, I haven't experienced any abdominal pain or bloating. My digestive system seems to be functioning normally. When I feel my abdomen, it feels soft and normal. There aren't any hard or tender areas. I've been feeling more anxious and stressed lately, likely due to my health concerns and the added pressures at work and home. It's been affecting my mood, and I found it harder to relax and unwind. I haven't been diagnosed with any specific mental health conditions, but the emotional toll of my symptoms has been significant. The last movie I watched in the cinema was a few months ago. It was a superhero film, The Guardian's Return. It was a fun escape and a nice break from the usual routine. Yes, I enjoy superhero films and action movies. I find them entertaining and a good way to unwind. I also like comedies and thrillers, depending on my mood. I really enjoy watching <REDACTED PII>. He's versatile and brings a lot of charisma to his roles, especially as Tony Stark in the Marvel movies. I admire <REDACTED PII>. Her range and ability to portray such diverse characters is truly impressive. She's always captivating to watch. My favourite Korean drama series is Crash Landing on You. I enjoyed the unique storyline, the chemistry between the lead characters and the blend of romance, comedy, and drama. It was a compelling show from start to finish."

I can't feel your spleen, there's no tenderness there either. From what you've described to me, it sounds as though your heart pain could be stress related. What I would suggest is that we just organise a full blood picture, some UNs and LFTs, and then we can do a scan of your abdomen. After that, we'll get you to come back and then I'll review how you're doing. I'll also send you to a physio for treatment of the chest pain. Then I will start you on some paracetamol that you can take for the pain as well. We'll get you to come back in about a month and then we'll review how things are going at that stage.

I don't like it's, you know, it's talk about, but yeah, it's a wee bit uh OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've had a bit of a sore throat. I mean, you know, I, I'm doing a lot of, uh, you know, watching the football as well. So I do a lot of shouting at that, but I'm not sure if that's related or not. Well, it's a team called <REDACTED PII>, and they're in the, they're not even in the top division, uh, Scottish League. They're actually in the, the, the championship, which is the league below that, and they're bottom of the table. Right. So, I've been shouting myself a wee bit hoarse because the performance has been, uh, pretty shy if I'm being honest with you. I shave every day, so I'm, I'm looking at myself. It's not, not, not a pretty sight, to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been uh a wee bit. A wee bit rough the last few days for sure. No, I mean, no, I, I don't, I don't really like to look, you know, to look after. So I, I, I haven't, I haven't tried to do any of that. Uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm 50 years old now. Mi's, you know, it's not as good as it used to be, but, you know, I, I think, I think it's all right. No, no, it's, it's, it's weird. It's, it's just, you know, it's just a wee bit shortness of breath, but it's not, it's not, it's not pain, you know, as such. Yeah, yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's definitely something I've noticed, like, you know, in, in bed with the wife I'm having to, you know, get out and get the blanket off and put it back on again.

The diarrhea is described as normal in color, but the patient has noted the presence of blood for the past couple of days, which is concerning. Prior to this episode, the patient had normal bowel habits, typically once every couple of days.</p>\n  <h4>Assessment:</h4>\n  <p>The patient exhibits crampy abdominal pain rated at 4/10, which alleviates somewhat after bowel movements. There are no reports of difficulty swallowing, mouth ulcers, or significant indigestion. The presence of blood in the stool and the change in bowel habits warrant further investigation to rule out any underlying pathology.</p>\n  <h4>Past Medical History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Family History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Social History:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Medications:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Allergies:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>Investigations:</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Nil recorded</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>I would greatly appreciate your clinical review and assessment, and any ongoing management that you may consider necessary.</p>\n  <p>Kind Regards,</p>\n</body>",

They probably need to get a gut specialist to have a look at you. If it hasn't got better in a matter of weeks, um, and they'll take it from there. But let me just summarise what's been happening there. So you've had this problem for about 2 or 3 weeks, but it is distinct diarrhoea around times today, sometimes overnight as well, and you have to get up to go, uh, you the abdominal pain and tummy pain, and you've got some blood, uh, in the motions, uh, as well. Um, there's no real past medical history apart from a little bit of migraine, you said, and the appendix, uh, you don't smoke at all, uh, now, um. alcohol, you know, we, we may need to talk about it later on, a little bit too much there, I think, uh, but you're worried about this because one of you or somebody you know had bowel cancer, uh, and you're, you're a bit concerned about an endoscopy as well. But would it be all right if we ran the blood test today and did the sample."

The diarrhoea is described as runnier and looser than normal, occurring up to 8 times a day. He has also noticed blood in his stool for the past couple of days, which is a significant concern for him. The diarrhoea is not difficult to flush away, and there is no undigested food present. He experiences crampy abdominal pain, primarily before bowel movements, which slightly alleviates after defecation. Eating does not seem to exacerbate the pain.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>Assessment:</h4>\n<p>The provisional diagnosis is gastrointestinal disturbance with possible underlying pathology given the presence of blood in the stool. Further investigation is warranted to rule out conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or other gastrointestinal disorders.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>Past Medical History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Family History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Social History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Medications:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Allergies:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Investigations:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>I would greatly appreciate your clinical review and assessment, and any ongoing management that you may consider necessary.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Kind Regards,</p>\n</body>",

She has previously undergone blood injections, physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory treatments, and shockwave therapy. Recently, she has experienced a flare-up of symptoms, possibly due to increased physical activity, including daily 5K walks. She reports pain when sitting, climbing stairs, and getting out of the car. The pain was severe enough to disrupt her sleep, although this has since settled.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>Assessment:</h4>\n<p>The patient has a history of hamstring tendon issues with recurrent flare-ups. The recent increase in physical activity may have contributed to the current symptoms. Further evaluation and management by a specialist in musculoskeletal conditions are recommended.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>Past Medical History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Hamstring tendon issues for over 15 years</li>\n<li>Previous treatments: blood injections, physiotherapy, anti-inflammatories, shockwave therapy</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Family History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Social History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Active lifestyle with daily 5K walks</li>\n<li>Recent changes in exercise routine</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Medications:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Anti-inflammatories as needed</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Allergies:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Investigations:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>MRI towards the end of the year (October/November) - details not provided</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>I would greatly appreciate your clinical review and assessment, and any ongoing management that you may consider necessary.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Kind Regards,</p>\n</body>",

OK, I'm going to say at this stage I've got to say the sound quality is not great, but I will continue because we've come this far, um, so, um, based on everything you mentioned, sir, I, I, I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. The reason being that you said it's quite itchy. It's affecting your chest and your back. Um, and, having looked at your skin, the rash does pick quite familiar. Um, you mentioned you using steroid creams yesterday, um, from the pharmacy. I wonder whether they're giving you stronger prescription of a steroid may be beneficial, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today as well as I'm going to give you some, some emollients which helps to moisturise the skin, um. in the bath and shower and it's definitely worth using that for the 1st 7 to 10 days, uh, before we make a decision on whether it's working or not. Um, it's also worth, um, using antihistamines, which can sometimes buy over the counter things like loratadine or Peritin, which can help with the itchiness of your skin. And uh keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap, because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about that next time I see you."

And you said you mentioned you live with your wife and two children. Is that right? Just a couple of other questions we need to ask, sir. Um, do you smoke at all? And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? So, um, normally at this stage, I'd like to, um, examine you if that's OK. But um, um, but, but having listened to your stories, uh, I think, um, just to recap for the last 3 days, you've been having loose stool, diarrhoea, a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left-hand side, and vomiting and being generally quite weak and lethargic, um, you mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well 3 days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems, it seems like you may have something uh called gastroenteritis. Which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your, of your tummy, um. Mainly caused by viruses, but they can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms. At this stage, uh, what, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management, so I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just um making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids, um, there are things like dire light you can get from the pharmacy, which, uh, it's, um, it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. Um, and if you're having vomiting and diarrhoea, I would say recommend that the first, you know, first couple of days. If you feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, uh, 2 tablets up to 4 times a day for the first few days can also help. I'll certainly advise you to take some time off work actually. I know you're quite keen to work. Um, I would say next 2 to 3 days, um, clears from your system, take some time off and rest. Um you know, if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in, in 3 to 4 days, I'd like to come back and see me again. OK, sure, because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms. Yeah, uh, and we may need to do further tests like um take your stool so we can test that, um, etc. etc. How's that sound? Do you have any questions for me? OK, is the treatment plan clear? Well, I wish you all the best. OK, thank you. Thank you. Bye bye."

Approximately a month ago, he began experiencing swelling and fluid accumulation in the ankle, which led to an X-ray being performed. Initially suspected to be gout, he was prescribed a medication regimen for 10 days, which reduced the swelling but did not resolve the primary issue. He has been using crutches for about a week and has been undergoing regular physiotherapy. Despite some improvement, he continues to experience alternating pain between the ankle joint and the Achilles tendon, particularly when attempting to pivot or put weight on the foot.</p>\n</br>\n<h4>Assessment:</h4>\n<p>The patient's symptoms suggest a possible underlying issue with the ankle joint or Achilles tendon that has not been fully addressed by the initial treatment. Further investigation is necessary to determine the exact cause of the persistent pain and discomfort.</p>\n<h4>Past Medical History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n</br>\n<h4>Family History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Social History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n</br>\n<h4>Medications:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n</br>\n<h4>Allergies:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded.</li>\n</ul>\n</br>\n<h4>Investigations:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>X-ray of the ankle - results not provided.</li>\n</ul>\n</br>\n<p>I would greatly appreciate your clinical review and assessment, and any ongoing management that you may consider necessary.</p>\n</br>\n<p>Kind Regards,</p>\n</body>",

He describes the cough as productive, bringing up a fair amount of mucus, but denies any blood in the sputum. The sore throat is constant and particularly bothersome when swallowing.

The anxiety manifests as dread about going to work, stress from interactions with a difficult boss, and worries about job performance. This has significantly impacted the patient's sleep, with difficulty falling asleep (taking hours to do so) and waking up with a racing heart, leading to shallow sleep of approximately 3 hours per night. The patient experiences palpitations, particularly in the morning when feeling panicked about being late for work. These symptoms have progressively worsened over the past two months.",

He reports associated cramping pain in the middle of his abdomen, which he rates as 6 out of 10 in severity. He also experiences nausea and occasional vomiting, particularly after consuming milk. Additionally, he feels hot and suspects he has a fever, although he has not measured his temperature. He has been trying to stay hydrated but feels that fluids are passing through him quickly.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>Assessment:</h4>\n<p>Based on the patient's history and symptoms, my provisional diagnosis is gastroenteritis, likely of infectious origin.

                            "text": "Doctor: Well how high are we talking? Initial reading will be 150/90, and then, you know, after relaxing you to come to about 138/85. Nice. That's, that's, you know, that's the highest I've ever seen. And probably some cholesterol tablets too. They're all heading kind of in the wrong direction. Uh, just increasing cholesterol and probably the big one is triglycerides? Uh, and you're heading towards diabetes as well. The HBA1C doesn't change, well, it lasts for 3 months, so it's not something which changes rapidly. Um, and it's been heading up since last year. So I think that's a trend. And then you had your colonoscopy. Is he doing anything about it? So he's going to see you again or what's my first? It's really unclear because like actually says high grade dysplasia. Which I don't like, that means that they are getting weirder. Like this, this isn't, you know, it's just a significant polyp to remove the colonoscopy. It doesn't say what else he wants, sir. What he wants to do about it. Because sometimes when you go to like the high grade range they want you in yearly. I'll email it as well because that's kind of, it's like pretty useless freaking letter. I mean, it's low grade, I'd be much less excited. So hi, so basically he goes low, medium, high cancer. Alright, so you're right, that's just like, oh, so some people like, no, we're gonna do this yearly until we're clear, some people are like, yeah, I just want to.Patient: Um, I am kind of wound up at the moment, so you want to do it, do you want to do it 24 hour? I don't think it's gonna prove anything that we don't already know. OK. I mean, you were considering, you said to be seriously considering blood pressure tablets. I think I do need them. Well, I was diagnosed as type 2 diabetes years ago. Um, and I was able to sort of keep that under control, but like I said, when I had those tests, I was, I was being really bad. I'm still not real good. In the report that I got, he said he found 5 polyps, I think it's a whole bunch they were uh they weren't a major concern. But um, and he didn't give me a, a another appointment to come back in 2 years, but, I presume that it's ongoing for my age. Yeah, when he spoke to me after the procedure, he seemed pretty relaxed. And the time before, uh, we found some larger polyps and he was, he seemed a little more concerned then, so. I, I contact these officers and find out. Yeah, I just took these kind of relaxed tone after the procedure that day wasn't too concerned. Um, and that, um, what he was writing in the letter was, credible standard for someone my age with my history. Hm, kind of what his history, you know, you know, my mum had um bowel cancer and that uh she was, theatre an operation for that um. So he's, he's, you know, well aware of family history.00:05:00 - 00:10:00Doctor: Heading well towards the diabetes, metabolically syndrome sort of thing. I think we should do something about that. So, I think blood pressure is a good thing to do to keep your kidneys safe. Something for the cholesterol to try and kind of just get a lid on that. And then I guess the options for, so technically you're not diabetic. But you're heading that way and I guess in my mind, diabetes like the set cut off at 6.5 for HP once a year at 5.9. Normal is 5.5. But it's probably not good being in that middle; it's not like everything's fine and then everything. Yeah, so you're halfway, halfway to making an official either way I'm more likely to fall the wrong way. Almost certainly will go the wrong way. Yeah, so that's kind of an arbitrary cut off. So I'm pretty aggressive about it because it's just a heck of a lot easier early than it is later. The thing is you're accumulating damage that whole time. You know, it's not like suddenly everything's fine, then everything's horrible. Things are getting progressively worse; you've got the sugar running around gumming up your plumbing. So there's a few options ranging from kind of cheap to expensive. Cheap is like metformin, which is your baseline standard sort of drug. You don't have any evidence of like kidney injury or anything like that yet, so that's good. So I'd say probably that's not a bad option. The kind of deluxe option is one of those new weight loss drugs. So like aic or um to zepotide. The big thing about them is that they help you lose weight; we know that carrying weight is one of the risk factors of diabetes. Yeah, that's good stuff that if you can lose 10 to 20% of body weight, all the risks drop back down. And that's kind of what these drugs offer. Mhm. They're expensive and they're an injection; it's probably the downside of it. Cost is roughly 450 to 650 a month. So you're looking at about 100 bucks a week. It kind of depends. Like if you do a takeout or two, that kind of works out that ongoing for life doesn't have to be, so it kind of depends on you, really. I mean I can't afford a lifetime of it. Yeah, so kind of depends on how good a change we manage to make. You know, if you use it for a few months and you manage to lose 10 kg and lifestyle-wise we manage to get everything else under control, you know, then you can probably come off it. You will likely regain some, but like, and that's kind of why I quite like the medication is it actually gives you a chance. If you can lose a chunk of body weight and then make some good changes, diet, exercise, all that, which is often easier when you're carrying a bit less weight. You know, I've got a couple of guys around there, 140 kg, so they can't do any exercise. He has a catch 22; they need it and they can't do it. Yeah, so that's kind of what I see it's useful. Some people like they just can't and so you end up being on it for life, though I'd expect most people. Like, so I've been using, I use to Zappatide more because it's got more weight loss potential; they quote it up to 20% like it's huge. And often even just a smaller doses, which I think are only 360 bucks that it's cheaper, because it goes from 5 milligrammes, 2.5 milligrammes up to 15, 15 is 645 is cheaper. I've already had stellar success just fiddling around the 2.5s for guys who've lost about 10 kilos in 2 months.Patient: Yep. Right. Oh, I can't afford that. A month, yeah. I mean I can't afford a lifetime of.Patient: So anticipate they'll probably stay on.00:10:00 - 00:15:00Doctor: So anticipate they'll probably stay on for maybe 6 months maybe 6 to 12. One of the interesting things about these medications, most people report craving less food. Actually reduces that kind of. Is it a habit? I'd prefer you to have nuts and jerky and that sort of stuff. So they did a good study in Google, so it's the same thing because there's a policy in Google you can't be more than 30 metres from a snack. So the snack sections put in everywhere. Everyone can have diabetes and everything because I had like all the bowls of M&Ms and pretzels and all this stuff. I still want to give people a choice, but it is cool behavioural thing where they just put it under the table. All the soft drinks were behind opaque glass, you know, water was visible, Healthy snacks were visible and that actually makes a significant difference because fundamentally we're fairly lazy creatures, you go for the available. So one of the strategies is to just make it harder to get. There are also time lock saves you can get. So, you know, you can only once a day or. Yeah, um, so yeah, look, there's strategies like that, so like, you know, putting them in under some sort of, just makes it harder.Patient: My big problem is discipline. I know I eat badly. I eat well, but I know I eat a lot of sweet stuff as well. And I don't exercise as much as I should. You know, I'll go for walks but not, not uh, I might go for 5 in one week and then I do one for a week. So I know that routine item with the routine and I with the regular diet. I don't know, maybe if I lost. Mine's not even a craving, mine is like I'm a picker. I'll go past food, pick it up and eat it. And I'll pick up the stuff that I can eat with one hand, you know, I'll grab biscuits or a bit of cake or something like that, whatever's around that's easy to consume. I don't have to sit down with a, I don't have to peel an orange, and I don't have to wash an apple and all that sort of thing, I just pick it up and eat it. I used to have a lot of nuts, and that helped keep my cholesterol down. I haven't been having as many nuts recently as what I used to. I used to have a day job where I can't be peanuts. Oh no, it was almond cashew walnuts, walnuts. They're really good walnuts here. I knew the ones that helped keep the cholesterol down so I would eat those. But I had a desk job and I could keep the nuts on the desk and I could eat them. I'm doing more manual work now, so it's hard to walk around with a pocket full of nuts and what it is to have butts in your desk. So that's part of the reason that the snacking has become different. You can have a packet of Tim Tams in the pantry for a month unopened but you opened and I, and I'll finish them off within a couple of days. So you know it's just, it is my lack of discipline. I went through this thing where I was slicing up apples and other fruit and having that just sitting in a plastic tupperware. And that made it easier, you know, to grab a bit as I was going. But you know, laziness, I fell out of that habit. Sounds like you'd really like me to do on that. Not the ascentic but the other patide, no, it's an option. I do appreciate it it's expensive. I guess, putting it into context though, I mean, I want my lifestyle, you know, we eat out like once or twice a week, we'll have takeaway. I didn't do that, I could easily afford. I'm 70, I haven't changed yet. What's the likely to be to make those changes and so sometimes.00:15:00 - 00:20:00Doctor: We start with blood pressure. I'm going to make another appointment with you to see about this, um, I think you've got trigger thumb. Yeah, and then if that doesn't work, do you do that here?Patient: Oh yeah, I can give you a referral to just get it done over radiology place. It might be easier. My son <REDACTED PII> works at um, <REDACTED>, and because he's a staff member there, I can get treatment a discount or for free. Yeah, is there a possibility of seeing someone there or is it better places to go? OK. I had a tennis elbow, uh, an injection for tennis elbow at one stage, and they made it sound like, you know, a weird science that that um, that only the best can perform. I don't think I actually had it, but I was right on the edge. Could have been 10 years ago. Is metformin the um a drug that prevents people using things like, uh, eos?Doctor: Oh yeah, I can do them. It's a piece of piss, so easy. Technically speaking, the procedure, it's super easy. No, nowhere near that exciting. I mean, look, of course you can cock it up, but it's really not that hard. OK, so medication wise, blood pressure, cholesterol and I'll start you on the metformin. Were you officially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at some point? Doesn't really matter.Patient: Is metformin the drug that prevents people using things like EOs and antacids and? That's Enos. What's you know? Oh, it's a there's some drink to relieve.Doctor: No.Patient: So many stupid formulations of this.Doctor: You mean?Patient: Arginine.00:20:00 - 00:25:00Doctor: Yeah, so whatever's easier for you, but I suspect it'll be easier getting it and cheaper getting in it. More than the other place that will do a bulk build is vision radiology. I don't know what iMed will do for you. And I've sent you the scripts. No problems with your legs? Excellent. No worries, so, um, see how all that stuff's going in and out. I'll give you a blood test form. And we'll just check on how it's all going in about months. Have a think about whether you want to do anything. Um, have we ever done a calcium score for you? It's about 300 bucks and looks at to see if you've actually got clogging up in your. I mean, you're already on treatment, um, I suppose it'll dictate to them how excited you get? I mean, yeah. I'll give you a form, you can have a think about it. Um, the main use is for people who are not keen on starting things where if you're happy enough to start the additional benefits probably low, unless it shows I guess if it shows a really high, you know, we might push you along. Do you have any problems when you're doing your manual work, like do you get any chest pain or anything like that? OK, yeah. So we'll do the blood test in about 3 months, so I will do that, but.Patient: OK. Yeah, I just got them. Thank you. No, that'd be great, great. All right. No. Yeah, didn't have that done, he was good for her. Yeah I should do one at some stage. Ha. I don't get chest pain, no, but like I'm, I'm an asthmatic and I've always been out of breath easily, um. Symbicort if I'm, I'm doing, yeah, I'm on really, but that's been brilliant. Let's keep the authentic. Uh, like I'm, I'm more of a, I'm, I'm better with lifting weights and picking things up than I am with endurance. January? Anything else I need? Yeah. You. Thanks very much for all of that. It worked pretty well. But yeah, expensive."

Have you done PRP? No. That's the plus. Plant plasma, yeah, yeah, um, no, just the one out of my arm and they did another ultrasound at the avenue. Out there at that time. Um, and then I started, um, doing the shock wave after a few weeks. And that seemed to, I don't, I don't know much of it. How many times did you have it? I said, oh, probably about 5 times over 12 months. So I think I had 3 initially. And I, and I think I've had two other flare-ups. The last flare-up I had. I can. Um, was encoded and we were walking. Like snow tomorrow, um. In 2020, I saw him again because the last time she got and the last time she had with him so. I, so I played every sport. I was an absolute chimpane.

Um, and the other doctors, and we put my husband on. But I've been walking every day enjoy 5 and I've been getting a bit big because I'm feeling so good, you know, and I changed my programme. About a month ago and I don't know whether that was it. Excessive war, well, not excessive walking, but playing a beep Mo, speedy, I guess. Has flared up and here I feel it. Um, so I'm not playing table always with Tim was. It's many la trees for 57 days, trying to get the information on it. And I did that, I still do the work. Um, so that's when I came. Well then I stopped the gym and then I had to see Joan. She's close. You've got to do things. So I've gone back and see, um, and, and she's written a new programme, which is nothing but barely doing anything but just to arms and floor exercises rather than whites. OK. So that's where I'm at."

The patient has a history of engaging in various physical activities and has undergone multiple treatments, including MRI scans (last conducted in 2020), blood injections, shockwave therapy (approximately five sessions over 12 months), and physiotherapy. The patient reports flare-ups of pain, particularly after changes in physical activity routines, such as increased walking or specific gym exercises. The pain has been described as stinging and has occasionally disrupted sleep. The patient has also noted soreness in the right leg and issues with sitting due to discomfort in the hamstring origin area.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>Assessment:</h4>\n<p>On examination, the pain appears consistent with hamstring origin tendinopathy. The patient has undergone various standard treatments, including activity modification and physiotherapy, but continues to experience symptoms. The pain is exacerbated by activities involving rapid load changes, such as jumping or running, and is alleviated by more controlled exercises. The patient has been advised on tendon rehabilitation strategies, including progressive loading exercises and the use of cushions to reduce compression during sitting.</p>\n<br />\n<h4>Past Medical History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Hamstring tendinopathy</li>\n<li>History of ankle sprains</li>\n<li>Previous physiotherapy and shockwave therapy</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Family History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Social History:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Engages in regular physical activities, including walking and gym exercises</li>\n<li>History of playing multiple sports</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Medications:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Allergies:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nil recorded</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Investigations:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>MRI scan (2020) - details not provided</li>\n<li>Ultrasound - details not provided</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>I would greatly appreciate your clinical review and assessment, and any ongoing management that you may consider necessary. The patient may benefit from a tailored rehabilitation program to address the tendinopathy and associated symptoms.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Kind Regards,</p>\n</body>\n",
